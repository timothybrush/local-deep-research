Pre-commit hook: user-data constructions pass a username.

Scope: this hook is a syntax fence against ACCIDENTAL or IDIOMATIC
code -- the shapes a contributor writes without meaning to bypass
anything. Deliberate evasion by a contributor is out of scope and is
left to code review (CODEOWNERS); the hook does not try to be a
sandbox. Examples of deliberate evasion it does NOT catch (the list is
not exhaustive): a default supplied from outside the class body or
signature -- by a metaclass, decorator or ``__init_subclass__``, or set
after the class body (``Cls.attr = Depends()``, ``f.__defaults__ =
...``); walrus bindings in subscript targets or in
other annotations; module-level string or type aliases of a fenced name
(``Svc = "NoteService"`` then ``svc: Svc = Depends()``); and the known
gaps listed below.

LDR's cross-user object isolation is architectural: notes, documents,
downloads and research rows live in per-user *encrypted* databases, so
IDOR is impossible only while every access goes through a
service/session constructed for the requesting user.

What this hook checks is deliberately shallow -- a fast pre-commit
smoke check: every call to a constructor in ``USER_DATA_CONSTRUCTORS``
(by bare name, under an import alias such as ``from ... import
LibraryService as LS``, or as a module attribute ``mod.NoteService``)
under ``ISOLATION_SCAN_DIRS`` (the routers, ``research_library/`` and
``web/services/``) must pass a username explicitly: a positional
``username`` / ``self.username``-style name, or a keyword whose name
contains ``username`` (``username=``, ``owner_username=``). Any keyword
whose name contains ``username`` bound to a literal constant (``None``,
``"alice"``, a placeholder-free ``f"alice"``) is flagged, whatever the
other arguments are. A username-named *value* under another keyword
(``NoteService(owner=username)``) does not count. It catches a
defaulted or shared-session construction. Any non-literal ``username=``
expression is accepted, so constant-valued expressions such as
``username=str(None)`` or ``username=None or x`` are NOT flagged; nor
are dynamic lookups (``getattr``, ``importlib``).

A constructor must not leave a scanned file under a name this hook
does not recognise, since no rule follows a name across modules: an
import alias that is not itself a constructor name (``from x import
get_user_db_session as open_session``; leading underscores are
ignored, so ``as _get_user_db_session`` is fine and its calls are
checked) and any loaded non-call reference (``make = NoteService``,
``partial(get_user_db_session, ...)``, ``class Mine(NoteService)``)
are flagged, except in a type-only annotation. An annotation is NOT
type-only -- it counts as a reference, and a constructor quoted in a
string inside it counts too -- when it is evaluated into more than a
type: a parameter or class-body field annotation (wherever the field
sits in the class body, also under ``if`` / ``try``, and whatever
binds its name there: ``svc: NoteService`` then ``svc = Depends()``)
whose default is not a constant (``svc: NoteService = Depends()``, ``= Depends(None)``,
``= dep``: FastAPI then constructs the annotated class itself, with
``username`` filled from the request, e.g. ``?username=``), an
``Annotated[...]`` with a non-constant metadata element
(``Annotated[NoteService, Depends()]``, ``Annotated[T,
Depends(get_user_db_session)]``), a starred element
(``Annotated[*(NoteService, dep)]``) or a non-tuple slice, any call,
walrus or lambda inside it (``x: (s := get_user_db_session) = 1`` binds
the constructor in the enclosing scope), a class field with no binding
in its own class body on a class with a base other than ``object`` /
``Generic`` / ``Protocol`` (it may inherit a ``Depends()`` default), or
a string that does not parse. A string in a type position that does
not parse as an expression (``"*[NoteService]"`` is a valid ForwardRef
but not an expression) or nests deeper than ``_MAX_QUOTE_DEPTH`` is
also reported on its own, as an annotation string that cannot be
checked (strings that are plain values -- call arguments, ``Literal``
members, ``Annotated`` metadata -- are not). Every string in a type position is
parsed and checked like unquoted code, recursively, since FastAPI
evaluates it: a wholly quoted ``"Annotated[NoteService, Depends()]"``
is as live as the unquoted form (``Annotated`` metadata strings are
plain values and are not parsed). An attribute read off a
constructor is a non-call reference too (``NoteService.__call__``,
``get_user_db_session.__wrapped__``, ``NoteService.__new__(...)``,
``FollowUpResearchService.__call__()``, ``NoteService.some_method``),
since the attribute can be, or can produce, the unchecked constructor;
the only exemptions are an ALL_CAPS constant (``^[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*$``,
e.g. ``NoteAIService.MAX_CLAIMS_PER_NOTE``) and the
(constructor, attribute) pairs pinned in ``ALLOWED_ATTRIBUTE_READS``.
An ALL_CAPS attribute is exempt by its name alone, whatever it holds
(a callable bound to ``NoteService.FACTORY`` would not be seen).
Known gaps (NOT fenced): a rename, re-export, wrapper or dependency
factory in a module OUTSIDE ISOLATION_SCAN_DIRS (e.g. one in
``web/dependencies/`` that builds a ``NoteService`` from a request
parameter; for the routers, injecting such an identity-taking callable
via ``Depends`` is caught by the census test
``test_no_dependency_takes_a_user_identity_from_the_request``); dynamic
lookups (``getattr``, ``importlib``, ``__import__``, ``globals()`` /
``module.__dict__[...]``, ``eval``); ``Annotated`` reached through an
assignment alias (``A = Annotated``) with non-call metadata
(``svc: A[NoteService, dep]``; an ``import ... as`` alias is
recognised); and constant-valued non-literal ``username=`` expressions
(above). It
does NOT check where that username came from: ``NoteService(
victim_username)`` or ``get_user_db_session(username=request.
query_params["u"])`` pass here. Provenance (the value must be the
``require_auth``-derived username) is enforced by the census in
tests/security/test_cross_user_isolation_census.py
(``test_identity_sinks_only_ever_receive_the_authenticated_username``,
``test_every_get_user_db_session_call_is_passed_an_auth_username``)
for call sites in ``web/routers/*.py`` only; outside the routers this
hook's shape check is the only fence.

A file that cannot be read or parsed (syntax error, undecodable bytes,
nesting too deep for the parser, an OS error) is reported as an
offender, never skipped, and never crashes the run. Files are parsed
from bytes, so a UTF-8 BOM or a PEP 263 coding cookie is honoured.

The companion contract (tests/security/test_architecture_fences.py)
runs this same scanner over ISOLATION_SCAN_DIRS, pre-commit style
(repo-root cwd, repo-relative paths). Every path argument is made
absolute (relative ones against the cwd) and taken relative to the
repository root twice -- lexically (``..`` collapsed, symlinks not
followed) and resolved (symlinks followed) -- and the file is scanned
if EITHER form is in ISOLATION_SCAN_DIRS, so ``..`` segments, a
non-root cwd, or a symlink inside a scanned dir pointing elsewhere
cannot move a file out of scope. Repo files outside
ISOLATION_SCAN_DIRS (both forms) are skipped; files outside the
repository (mutation fixtures) are always scanned.

      FastAPI; ``x: (s := get_user_db_session) = 1`` binds it in the enclosing
      scope, since annotations are evaluated eagerly before 3.14);
    * it is a parameter's or a class-body field's annotation (a
      dataclass field becomes an ``__init__`` parameter) whose default
      is not a constant: ``svc: NoteService = Depends()``, ``= Depends(None)``
      or ``= dep`` with ``dep = Depends()`` makes FastAPI CALL the
      annotated class, filling its parameters from the request;
    * an ``Annotated[...]`` in it (under any import alias) carries a
      non-constant metadata element (``Annotated[class, dep]``), a
      starred element (``Annotated[*(class, dep)]``) or a slice that is
      not a tuple (``Annotated[args]``);

      deep (fail closed; one in a type position is also reported

    * it is a class field with no binding in its own class body, on a
      class with a base other than ``object`` / ``Generic`` /
      ``Protocol``: the field may inherit a non-constant default.

    Every string in a type position is parsed and checked like unquoted
    code, recursively (see ``_annotation_nodes``), so a wholly quoted
    ``"Annotated[class, Depends()]"`` is not type-only either. A class
    field counts wherever it sits in the class body, also under ``if`` /
    ``try`` / ``with`` / loops, and its default is any binding of its
    name there (``svc: T`` then ``svc = Depends()``; see
    ``_class_field_defaults``).

    Callee names are not matched, so ``Depends`` imported under another
    name cannot hide a dependency (fail closed). Return annotations and
    module- or function-level variable annotations have no default.
