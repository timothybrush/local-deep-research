"""Constants shared across pre-commit hooks in this directory.

Hooks in ``.pre-commit-hooks/`` are standalone scripts — they don't form
a package — so constants they must agree on can drift silently when
duplicated across files. This module is the single source of truth for
such constants; hooks load it with the same ``sys.path`` + ``from
_hook_common import ...`` idiom that the ``_commit_analysis`` consumers
in this directory use (see e.g. ``recommend-docs.py``).

Add sparingly: when a new constant cluster emerges, prefer splitting it
into a domain-named module over growing this file into a catch-all.

# Directories where ``logger.exception()`` routes through the diagnose-gated
# ``security.secure_logging`` wrapper: the message is production-visible at
# ERROR level (only the traceback is gated), so interpolating the raw
# exception variable leaks error details there just like any other level
# (#4183). Outside these directories, ordinary loguru exception output
# follows the configured sinks; this tuple does not make it dev-only.
