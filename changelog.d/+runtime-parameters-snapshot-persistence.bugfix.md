Synchronized per-research runtime parameter overrides (`search_engine`,
`model_provider`, `model`, `custom_endpoint`, `iterations`,
`questions_per_iteration`, `strategy`, `max_results`, `time_period`) onto the
captured `settings_snapshot` in the start-research precheck, the persisted
snapshot, and the background worker. Previously those kwargs were not written
into the snapshot, so LangGraph tools, telemetry, and source-based iteration
counts read saved database defaults instead of the run's explicit overrides.

Envelope metadata (`{"value": ...}`) is preserved when overlaying so
snapshot readers that call `.get("value")` keep working.

Plumbed `max_iterations` and `questions_per_iteration` through
`SourceBasedSearchStrategy`, `create_strategy`, and
`EnhancedContextualFollowUpStrategy` (forwarded to its delegate strategy).
Programmatic `_init_search_system` only overlays kwargs that were actually
passed, so a snapshot-only `quick_summary` / MCP call is no longer forced to
`source-based` with 1 iteration.

Added boundary validation for `iterations` (1–100) and
`questions_per_iteration` (1–20) at entrypoints, rejecting non-integers,
booleans, floats, JSON `Infinity`/`NaN`, and out-of-bounds values with 400.

User-visible behavior changes:
* REST `quick_summary` no longer forces `iterations=1`, allowing runs to
  inherit the caller's configured `search.iterations` setting (or fall back to
  the router default of 5 when unset in the database).
* Under `policy.egress_scope == strict`, the requested per-run engine is no
  longer written into `search.tool` by any overlay (start-research precheck,
  REST `/api/v1/quick_summary`, programmatic
  `quick_summary` / `generate_report` / `detailed_research`, background
  worker). The saved primary remains the STRICT reference on every path —
  a STRICT user can no longer use `search_engine="searxng"` to widen a
  run whose saved primary is, e.g., `library`. A run with no valid saved
  STRICT primary (blank/missing `search.tool`) now fails closed instead of
  letting the request choose its own primary. Under ADAPTIVE egress
  scope, the start-research precheck still evaluates the requested engine
  as the run primary, aligning the precheck with worker-level policy
  enforcement and updating which engine override requests receive 400
  refusals.

Report-generation fix:
* `IntegratedReportGenerator._research_and_generate_sections` now also
  overrides `max_iterations` on the active strategy's `delegate_strategy`
  (e.g. the `SourceBasedSearchStrategy` wrapped by
  `EnhancedContextualFollowUpStrategy`) for the duration of each subsection
  search. Previously the override only touched the wrapper, so under the
  follow-up strategy each report subsection ran the delegate's full
  configured iteration loop instead of one, multiplying search/LLM work
  and latency across every section of every detailed report.

Request-validation order:
* A missing `query` now outranks `iterations` /
  `questions_per_iteration` validation on `POST /api/start_research`
  (both the wrapper and `_start_research_sync`): a body with no query
  reports "Query is required" even when the iteration fields are also
  invalid, matching the `api_v1` query-first order.

Worker context:
* Under non-STRICT scopes, `build_run_egress_context` with a valid saved
  primary and no requested engine now proceeds with the saved engine
  (previously raised). No request influence; blank saved + blank
  requested still refuses.

REST error contract:
* `POST /api/v1/quick_summary`, `/generate_report`, and
  `/analyze_documents` map a `PolicyDeniedError` from the research call
  (e.g. STRICT blank saved primary) to a curated 400 ("Egress policy
  refused this request: ...") instead of the generic 500 — a curated 400
  like the global handler's, in the api_v1 `{"error": ...}` envelope
  matching its sibling 400/504s.
