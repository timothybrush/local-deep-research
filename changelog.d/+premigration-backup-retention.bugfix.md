The automatic backup taken before a database migration no longer deletes
backups that your `backup.max_count` and `backup.max_age_days` settings would
keep. It used to apply the built-in limits (one backup, seven days), so the
first sign-in that ran a migration removed every older backup. It now reads
your retention settings, and if they cannot be read before the migration, or
are not whole numbers between 1 and the settings' maximums (30 backups, 90
days), it deletes nothing, including stale temporary files.
Removing older backups can no longer delete the backup that has just been
written, whatever the retention values. For the regular backup (not the
pre-migration one), an `LDR_BACKUP_MAX_AGE_DAYS` of 0 or less, or one too
large to turn into a date (for example 1000000, "keep forever"), now turns
off only the age limit: `backup.max_count` still applies and stale temporary
files are still removed. For the regular backup, an `LDR_BACKUP_MAX_COUNT` of
0 or less is treated as 1, so the newest backup is kept. A new backup is also
kept, rather than deleted, if removing older backups fails.
