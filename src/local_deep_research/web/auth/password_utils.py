"""
Shared utilities for resolving the current user's DB password under FastAPI.

``get_user_password`` retrieves the user's password from the FastAPI session
password store.

The Flask-era version of this helper had a 3-source fallback chain
(session_password_store → Flask g.user_password → temp_auth_store).
The Flask sources became dead after the FastAPI migration:
``has_request_context()`` always returns False without Flask running,
and there is no FastAPI middleware that mirrors password into a
contextvar-accessible "g". Under FastAPI, the password is written to
``session_password_store`` directly during login (auth.py) keyed by
``session_id``, so Source 1 covers every authenticated request path.

``resolve_user_password`` builds on it with the encryption-aware guard the
research entry points share: it returns ``(password, session_expired)`` so
a caller can reject a run when an encrypted DB has no available password.

    Returns ``(password, session_expired)``:

    - ``session_expired`` is ``True`` only when the database is encrypted
      and no password is available. The caller MUST reject the request
      (e.g. a 401 telling the user to log back in) because the research's
      background DB and metric writes would otherwise be silently dropped
      (issue #4457) — research would appear to run while every metric write
      fails. Trigger: session-password-store TTL expiry or a server/
      container restart while the session cookie is still valid.
    - For unencrypted databases ``session_expired`` is always ``False``;
      the returned ``password`` may legitimately be ``None``.

    Centralises the guard that the direct (``/start_research``), follow-up,
    and chat research entry points all need, so the encryption-aware
    decision and its logging live in one place instead of being copied
    (and risking divergence) across routes. Each route still formats its
