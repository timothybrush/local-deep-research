Automatic cleanup of idle database connections.

Periodically closes database connections for users who have no active sessions
and no active research, preventing resource leaks when users close their browser
without logging out.

Also periodically disposes all QueuePool engines to release accumulated WAL/SHM
file handles. See ADR-0004 for why this is necessary with SQLCipher + WAL mode.

# File Descriptor Monitoring
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHY: After days of idle operation in Docker, the app crashed with
#   OSError: [Errno 24] Too many open files
# This monitoring logs the FD count every 5 minutes so we can correlate
# FD growth with specific events and find leaks.
#
# WHAT IT LOGS:
#   - open_fds: total open file descriptors for the process
#   - pool_engines: number of per-user QueuePool engines
#   - pool_checked_out: connections currently checked out from QueuePool
#   - protected_users: users with active sessions
#
# HOW TO USE: grep "Resource monitor" in container logs. If open_fds
# grows steadily over hours, something is leaking.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Dispose all pool engines every 30 minutes to release WAL/SHM handles.
# SQLCipher + WAL mode leaks handles when connections close out of order
# (which QueuePool's pool_recycle causes). Periodic dispose() closes ALL
# pooled connections at once, resetting the handle state cleanly.
# The next DB operation transparently reopens a fresh connection.
