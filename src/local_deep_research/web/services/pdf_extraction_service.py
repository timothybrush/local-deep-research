        """
        Extract text and metadata from PDF in a single pass.

        This method opens the PDF only once and extracts both text content
        and metadata (page count) in the same operation, avoiding the
        performance issue of opening the file multiple times.

        What is bounded (``utilities/pdf_extraction_limits``): text is
        extracted from at most ``MAX_PDF_EXTRACTION_PAGES`` pages, at most
        ``MAX_PDF_EXTRACTED_CHARS`` characters are kept (separators
        included; the page that crosses the ceiling is truncated to the
        budget left), and no new page is started once the calling thread
        has spent ``MAX_PDF_EXTRACTION_CPU_SECONDS`` of its own CPU time
        (``time.thread_time()``) since entry. The page tree is walked
        lazily (``utilities/pdf_page_walk``), so a document declaring more
        pages than the ceiling has at most the ceiling's pages (plus the
        one that shows there are more) built, not all of them. Every page
        the walk reaches is closed once done with, which releases its
        per-page layout caches; what pdfminer decodes and parses for a
        page stays cached on the document after that, so the walk hands
        each page to a releaser (``utilities/pdf_stream_release``) that
        releases those caches once they reach
        ``MAX_PDF_RETAINED_DECODED_BYTES``.

        What is NOT bounded: the budget is checked between pages only,
        so neither ``pdfplumber.open`` (the cross-reference parse) nor a
        single page's ``extract_text()`` can be interrupted, and what one
        page decodes and parses is held until the release after it.

        Args:
            pdf_content: Raw PDF file bytes
            filename: Original filename (for logging)

        Returns:
            Dictionary with keys:
            - 'text': Extracted text content
            - 'pages': Number of pages the walk reached. When the walk
              stops early (a ceiling, or the CPU budget) the pages after
              it are never built, so this is a lower bound and
              'truncated' is True. The page tree's declared ``/Count``
              is deliberately not read: resolving it can loop inside
              pdfminer (a self-referencing object, or an object-stream
              or ``/Length`` reference cycle) after the CPU budget has
              stopped applying
            - 'size': File size in bytes
            - 'filename': Original filename
            - 'truncated': True if a page or character ceiling, or the
              CPU budget, stopped the extraction early (False otherwise, including failures)
            - 'success': Boolean indicating success
            - 'error': Error message if failed (None if successful)

        Raises:
            No exceptions - errors are captured in return dict
