"""Reconstruct the legacy "full report" view from structured storage.

`research.report_content` stores only the synthesized answer (with inline
`[N](url)` hyperlinks). Sources live in the `research_resources` table;
metrics live in `research.research_meta`. This module rebuilds the
combined `answer + ## Sources + ## Research Metrics` view on demand for
display and export — chat reads `research.report_content` directly and
never goes through this module.

The legacy Sources guard expects the first non-blank entry to use the
bracketed bibliography shape (`[N]`, grouped `[N, M]`, or historical `[]`)
and to carry an indented `URL:` continuation line. Indexed entries mirror
`text_optimization.citation_formatter._BIB_SOURCES_PATTERN`; the empty-index
variant covers rows emitted before every source had an index. The currently
dormant `advanced_search_system.findings.repository.format_links` instead
emits `1. Title` entries, so it must not become a persisted Sources emitter
without extending this guard and its round-trip tests.

DO NOT write the assembled output back to `research.report_content` —
that column must stay answer-only. Writing assembled output back would
silently re-introduce the regex over-strip class of bugs that
answer-only storage avoids.
