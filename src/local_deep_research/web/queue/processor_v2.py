        ``UserActiveResearch`` exists to count what a user currently has
        running. Main deleted finished rows from a ``before_request`` hook
        (``web/auth/cleanup_middleware.cleanup_completed_research``) that
        sampled ~1% of requests, walked the user's rows, and dropped any
        whose thread was no longer active. That hook has no successor
        under FastAPI, and nothing replaced its *delete*: the spawn-failure
        branches drop their own row, but neither terminal notification
        below did, so every normally-completed research left its row
        behind permanently.

        The visible effect is not a wrong concurrency count —
        ``reclaim_stale_user_active_research`` re-derives that at the
        user's next start, so the cap self-heals — but the rows are never
        removed, only flipped to FAILED, and only for a user who starts
        another research. A user who finishes and stops accumulates rows
        with no purge path anywhere in the codebase, and the ones that do
        get reclaimed are mislabelled FAILED despite having succeeded.

        Deleting at the terminal notification is strictly better than
        main's sampled sweep: it is event-driven, so it cannot miss, and
        it costs one statement on a path that already holds an open
        session — no extra connection, no per-request overhead.
