"""Request-arrival/duration forensics for CI test runs (issue #4431).

The UI test shards intermittently fail with 60-second navigation
timeouts, and the server logs go silent for the same window — but the
app only logs explicit events, so a silent window cannot distinguish
"the request never reached the server" (connection-level stall: listen
backlog, docker-proxy, browser socket pool starved by engine.io polls)
from "the request reached the app and hung" (app-level stall: lock, DB
pool, GIL hog).

This middleware settles that by logging every request's arrival and its
WSGI-call duration.

STATUS: NOT WIRED UP. On main this was installed by ``app_factory``'s
``create_app`` (wrapping ``app.wsgi_app``) only when CI or TESTING was
set. The FastAPI port deleted ``app_factory.py`` and never ported that
wiring, and ``RequestTimingMiddleware`` below is still a plain WSGI
callable (``__call__(environ, start_response)``), so it cannot be handed
to ``app.add_middleware`` as-is. Nothing in ``src/`` imports it; only
``tests/web/utils/test_request_timing.py`` exercises the class directly.
Re-arming the #4431 forensics needs an ASGI rewrite plus a conditional
registration in ``fastapi_app.py`` — a code change, not a doc fix.

Log format (kept compact — engine.io polls arrive every ~5s/client):
    [req] > GET /chat/
    [req] < GET /chat/ 0.04s
Slow completions get a WARNING with the duration, which the CI workflow
log-grep surfaces.

Freeze thread-dump (dead-man's switch)
--------------------------------------
The arrival log proves *that* the pipeline froze, but not *what* it was
stuck on. So this middleware also arms ``faulthandler.dump_traceback_later``
and re-arms it on every request arrival. If no request arrives for
``FREEZE_DUMP_SECONDS`` (i.e. a freeze), faulthandler dumps ALL thread
stacks to stderr — and because it runs on a dedicated C timer thread it
fires even when the GIL is starved, which a Python watchdog thread could
not. During a ~60s freeze this yields 2-3 dumps showing exactly which
threads are blocked (werkzeug accept loop? a lock? a DB/SQLCipher call?
the scheduler?). Healthy operation re-arms the timer faster than it
fires, so no dumps appear. Captured in the CI server-log artifact.
