    """Provide documentation on available API endpoints.

    Hand-written rather than derived from FastAPI's OpenAPI schema. Review
    asked why; the answer is three things that are each checkable today.

    *The generated schema is currently thinner than this dict, not richer.*
    No route in this app declares a Pydantic request body or a
    ``response_model`` — every handler parses ``await request.json()`` by hand
    and returns a bare dict — so ``app.openapi()`` renders the three research
    POSTs with **no** ``requestBody`` member at all and a ``{}`` (any JSON) 200
    schema. It therefore never mentions ``query``, ``collection_name`` or
    ``allow_default_settings``, let alone that the first two are required, and
    it carries no securityScheme because access here is a session cookie
    checked by ``require_api_access`` rather than a declared scheme. Until
    these routes gain request/response models, this dict is the only place a
    caller learns the request shape.

    *And the generated schema is off by default.* ``openapi_url`` is gated on
    ``LDR_EXPOSE_DOCS`` in ``fastapi_app.py`` so a multi-user deployment does
    not publish its entire surface unauthenticated: ``/openapi.json`` 404s on a
    default install, while this route is served and API-gated.

    *It is also curated, not exhaustive.* It advertises the three research
    endpoints and deliberately omits ``/health`` and this route itself, and its
    parameter prose (the ``allow_default_settings`` egress-policy note in
    particular) states a security consequence no schema would infer from types.
    Callers already parse this shape.

    Hand-written means it can drift, so it cannot:
    ``tests/web/routers/test_api_v1_documentation_is_current.py`` fails if a
    documented path is not served, or if a POST route is added here without
    being advertised. If the routes ever do gain request/response models, that
    test is the seam to converge on: the generated schema becomes the source of
    truth and this body can be derived from it.
