class NotificationManager:
    """
    High-level notification manager that uses settings snapshots for
    thread-safe access to user settings.

    This manager is designed to be used from background threads (e.g., queue
    processors) by passing a settings_snapshot dictionary captured from the
    main thread.

    **Per-User Rate Limiting:**
    The rate limiter is shared across ALL NotificationManager instances as a
    singleton, but supports per-user rate limit configuration. Each user has
    their own rate limits based on their settings, which are configured when
    the NotificationManager is initialized with the required user_id parameter.

    **How It Works:**
    - The first NotificationManager instance creates the shared RateLimiter
      with default limits
    - Each instance configures user-specific limits by passing user_id to __init__
    - The rate limiter maintains separate counters and limits for each user
    - Users are completely isolated - one user's limit doesn't affect others

    Example:
        >>> # User A with conservative limits
        >>> snapshot_a = {"notifications.rate_limit_per_hour": 5}
        >>> manager_a = NotificationManager(snapshot_a, user_id="user_a")
        >>> # ✅ user_a gets 5/hour
        >>>
        >>> # User B with generous limits (doesn't affect User A!)
        >>> snapshot_b = {"notifications.rate_limit_per_hour": 20}
        >>> manager_b = NotificationManager(snapshot_b, user_id="user_b")
        >>> # ✅ user_b gets 20/hour, user_a still has 5/hour

class RateLimiter:
    """
    Simple in-memory rate limiter for notifications with per-user limit support.

    This rate limiter tracks notification counts per user and enforces
    configurable rate limits. Each user can have their own rate limits,
    which are stored separately from the notification counts.

    **Per-User Limits:**
    Rate limits can be configured per-user using `set_user_limits()`.
    If no user-specific limits are set, the default limits (passed to
    __init__) are used.

    **Memory Storage:**
    This implementation stores rate limits in memory only, which means
    limits are reset when the server restarts. This is acceptable for normal
    users since they cannot restart the server. If an admin restarts the server,
    rate limits reset which is reasonable behavior.

    **Thread Safety:**
    This implementation is thread-safe using threading.Lock() for concurrent
    requests from the same user.

    **Multi-Worker Limitation:**
    In multi-worker deployments, each worker process maintains its own rate
    limit counters. Users could potentially bypass rate limits by distributing
    requests across different workers, getting up to N × max_per_hour
    notifications (where N = number of workers). For single-worker deployments
    (the default for LDR), this is not a concern. For production multi-worker
    deployments, consider implementing Redis-based rate limiting.

    Example:
        >>> limiter = RateLimiter(max_per_hour=10, max_per_day=50)
        >>> # Set custom limits for specific user
        >>> limiter.set_user_limits("user_a", max_per_hour=5, max_per_day=25)
        >>> limiter.set_user_limits("user_b", max_per_hour=20, max_per_day=100)
        >>> # Users get their configured limits
        >>> limiter.is_allowed("user_a")  # Limited to 5/hour
        >>> limiter.is_allowed("user_b")  # Limited to 20/hour
        >>> limiter.is_allowed("user_c")  # Uses defaults: 10/hour
