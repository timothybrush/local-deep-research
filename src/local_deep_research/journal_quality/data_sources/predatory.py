"""Stop Predatory Journals data source.

Community successor to Jeffrey Beall's original predatory publishers
list (Beall took down his original blog post in 2017). The successor
project maintains three CSV files (publishers, journals, hijacked) on
GitHub which we merge into a single predatory.json.
