"""Bulk-fetch and lazy-load journal-quality datasets.

This module is now a thin orchestration layer over the
`data_sources` package. Each academic dataset is a `DataSource`
subclass; this module just iterates `ALL_SOURCES` to drive the bulk
download flow (the dashboard "Download Data" button) and to compute the
status payload returned by the `/metrics/api/journal-data/status`
endpoint.

Public API (kept stable for existing callers and tests):
- `JOURNAL_DATA_VERSION`
- `get_journal_data_status()`
- `download_journal_data(force=False)`
- `ensure_journal_data(auto_download=True)`

Test-patch surface (kept stable for tests that mock by string path):
- `_get_data_dir`
- `_fetch_openalex_sources` (re-export shim)
- `_fetch_doaj_journals` (re-export shim)

Data source registry lives in `.data_sources` and is the single source
of truth for source metadata, fetch logic, and download policy.
