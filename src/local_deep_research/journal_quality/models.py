"""SQLAlchemy declarative models for the compiled journal-quality DB.

These models map onto the read-only `journal_quality.db` SQLite file
that is built by `db.build_db()` from the gzipped JSON snapshots in
the user data directory. They are deliberately flat — no relationships
between tables — so that statement caching keeps per-query ORM
overhead in the ~100–300 µs range for the filter hot path.

Three tables:

- `sources`     — academic venues (journals + conferences) with
                  h-index, impact factor, DOAJ flags, predatory flags.
                  Compiled from OpenAlex sources + DOAJ + Stop Predatory
                  Journals + CORE conferences.
- `institutions`— OpenAlex institutions with h-index and ROR ID,
                  used by the Tier 3.5 affiliation-based scoring path.
- `abbreviations`— JabRef journal-name abbreviation expansions used by
                  Tier 2 name normalization (e.g. "Phys. Rev. Lett."
                  → "Physical Review Letters").

The DB is rebuilt from scratch after every download, so schema changes
ride along automatically — no Alembic, no migration plumbing.
