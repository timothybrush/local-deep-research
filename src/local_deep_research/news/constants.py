    ``FolderManager.update_folder`` used to accept any key for which
    ``hasattr(folder, key)`` was true on the live SQLAlchemy instance --
    which holds not just for real columns but also for ORM internals like
    ``_sa_instance_state``, ``metadata``/``registry``, and the bound
    ``to_dict`` method. A request body could therefore corrupt ORM
    identity state or shadow ``to_dict`` on the instance (breaking the
    route's own ``folder.to_dict()`` call on the same request). Restrict
    updates to the model's real, user-editable columns instead.

    Field-name allowlisting alone isn't enough: ``FolderManager.update_folder``
    does a blind ``setattr(folder, key, value)`` loop over whatever survives
    here, straight into the SQLAlchemy session. A wrong-typed value (e.g.
    ``{"sort_order": "abc"}``) either dies as an opaque 500 at
    ``session.commit()`` or, thanks to SQLite's dynamic column typing,
    silently coerces/stores the wrong type instead of erroring at all. So
    type-check each field here too, mirroring
    :func:`normalize_compact_subscription_update`'s style -- an invalid body
    must never reach the session.

    Keys in :data:`FOLDER_READONLY_ECHO_FIELDS` (``id``, ``created_at``,
    ``updated_at``) are accepted but ignored rather than rejected: they are
    exactly what ``folder.to_dict()`` echoes back, so a client doing a
    normal read-modify-write round trip always resends them. The final
    dict comprehension below still only pulls from
    ``FOLDER_UPDATABLE_FIELDS``, so none of them ever reaches ``setattr`` --
    this only changes whether *mentioning* them 400s the whole request.
