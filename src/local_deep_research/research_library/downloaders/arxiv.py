        Four sources, each a strictly weaker guarantee than the one before.

        it is the explicit one; then an
        ``<annotation encoding="application/x-tex+html">`` child, the same
        TeX with the HTML LaTeXML kept around it; then the ``alttext``
        attribute LaTeXML always writes onto the element itself; and finally
        the element's visible MathML text, read with the annotation
        subtrees skipped so annotation state is never mistaken for rendered
        characters, so a bare unannotated equation
        still yields its rendered characters instead of its annotation state
        (#4783). Only annotations are removed: presentation elements that
        lay out without drawing, such as ``<mphantom>``, keep their text in
        this tier. An empty source falls through rather than abandoning the
        page -- an element can carry an empty annotation and a usable one
        beside it, or an empty annotation and a usable attribute, and there
        is no reason to prefer the empty one. Every annotation of each
        encoding is examined for that reason, not just the first descendant
        -- but only the outermost of a nested run: an annotation nested in a
        same-encoding annotation contributes a subset of its ancestor's
        text, so once the ancestor reads as empty every annotation inside it
        does too. Reading only outermost matches keeps their subtrees
        disjoint, so each encoding's search, text extraction included, is
        one linear pass over the element; re-reading every level of a
        nested chain would be quadratic in its depth, and this HTML is
        author-controlled.

        ``<annotation-xml>`` is deliberately not a source: it holds a
        different encoding, the anchored matcher above already excludes it,
        and the visible-text tier skips it — along with every other
        non-TeX ``<annotation>`` — in the text it reads, so its hidden
        text can neither supply an empty equation nor pollute a rendered
        one. A node whose only text is annotation text reads as empty and
        takes the PDF exit.

        a report: the page carries more than MAX_MATH_ELEMENTS equations, or a
        <math> offers no TeX at all.

        "No TeX at all" is narrower than it used to be. The annotation child
        is not the only place LaTeXML writes the TeX -- it always writes it
        into the ``alttext`` attribute as well, while the parallel
        <annotation> markup depends on how arXiv invokes it, so a rendition
        carrying only ``alttext`` used to take the PDF exit with its TeX
        sitting right there on the element (#6414). Both sources are read
        now, annotation first. Partially annotated renditions go further and
        mix TeX-annotated equations with bare MathML (#4783): the recovery
        ladder reads x-tex annotations, then x-tex+html ones, then
        ``alttext``, then the element's visible MathML text, so a node kills
        the page only when it is genuinely empty -- no annotation, no
        attribute, and no rendered characters to keep.

        Each element is rewritten in place -- renamed to an inline <span>
        holding the TeX -- rather than with ``Tag.replace_with``. replace_with
        locates the element with a linear scan of its parent's contents, so
        rewriting n equations that share one parent costs O(n^2); arXiv
        renders this HTML from author-submitted LaTeX, and it is reached on
        the search path. Rewriting in place is linear and keeps bs4's own
        escaping on serialization.

        Only outermost <math> elements are rewritten. Each one's TeX comes
        from its own subtree (the annotation search, and the visible-text
        tier's walk), so a <math> nested inside another is covered by its
        ancestor and is discarded with the ancestor's children. Visiting
        the nested ones as well would re-read every level of a nested
        chain, making the rewrite quadratic in the nesting depth (nested
        <math> is not valid MathML, but this HTML is author-controlled).
        Outermost elements have disjoint subtrees, so the total work is
