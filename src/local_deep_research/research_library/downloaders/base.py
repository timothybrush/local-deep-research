def rate_limit_authority(url: str) -> str:
    """Return *url*'s authority (``host`` or ``host:port``) for rate-limit keys.

    RFC 3986 userinfo, path, query and fragment are dropped and an IPv6
    literal keeps its brackets. A URL with no authority at all yields
    ``""``; one whose authority will not parse (an invalid port, an
    unterminated ``[``) or whose host carries whitespace or a control
    character yields ``"invalid_authority"``.

    All four downloader fetch paths derive their per-host adaptive
    rate-limit bucket through this one helper, so the keys cannot drift
    apart. It parses the *original* URL rather than re-parsing
    ``redact_url_for_log(url)``: that helper is a display formatter, and its
    rendering of an input it cannot parse has no authority left to recover
    -- ``"  https://slow-host.example/paper"`` renders as ``"?://  https"``,
    while ``requests`` lstrips that same leading whitespace and fetches the
    URL anyway. Re-parsing the rendering therefore dropped every
    whitespace-prefixed host into one shared bucket, where a single
    429-heavy host raises the wait for all the others.

    ``AdaptiveRateLimitTracker`` renders the key into its own log messages,
    so the value must stay one printable token. A host carrying whitespace
    or a control character is not a legal RFC 3986 reg-name, and is not the
    host contacted either -- ``requests`` percent-encodes it, preparing
    ``"https://exa mple.com/p"`` as ``https://exa%20mple.com/p`` -- so it
    buckets as ``"invalid_authority"`` rather than being echoed into a log
    line.

        """
        Extract text from PDF content using in-memory processing.

        This is part of the public API and can be used by other modules.

        What is bounded (``utilities/pdf_extraction_limits``): at most
        ``MAX_PDF_EXTRACTION_PAGES`` pages are extracted, at most
        ``MAX_PDF_EXTRACTED_CHARS`` characters are returned (separators
        included; the page that crosses the ceiling is truncated to the
        budget left), and no new page is started once the calling thread
        has spent ``MAX_PDF_EXTRACTION_CPU_SECONDS`` of its own CPU time
        (``time.thread_time()``, so GIL waits and other requests' load do
        not count) since entry. pypdf keeps every stream it decodes and
        every object it parses on the reader; a releaser
        (``utilities/pdf_stream_release``) releases them once they reach
        ``MAX_PDF_RETAINED_DECODED_BYTES``, so what the walk holds
        between pages stays near that threshold.

        What is NOT bounded: the budget is checked between pages only,
        so neither a single page's ``extract_text()`` nor pypdf's
        page-tree construction (``PdfReader`` and the first access to its
        pages, O(all pages) in time and memory for a file with many pages)
        can be interrupted, and what one page decodes and parses is held
        until the release after it.

        Args:
            pdf_content: PDF file content as bytes
            max_pages: Maximum number of pages to extract (oldest-first).
                None (default) extracts all pages, preserving the historic
                behavior for dedicated PDF paths. Bounded callers (e.g. the
                HTML-downloader recovery path, reachable from any
                HTML-classified URL) pass a small cap so a crafted PDF with
                many pages cannot turn one ingest into unbounded CPU/memory
                work -- pypdf caps each stream but not the document total.
