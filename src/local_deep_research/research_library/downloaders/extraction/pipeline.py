Shared extraction pipeline.

Two entry points:
    extract_content(html) — HTML string in, clean text out.
    fetch_and_extract(url) — URL in, clean text out (static + JS fallback).

This is the single source of truth for content extraction in the project.
Used by HTMLDownloader, ContentFetcher, FullSearchResults, WaybackSearchEngine,
and any other code that needs clean text from a web page.

Academic URLs (arXiv, PubMed, bioRxiv, etc.) are automatically routed to
specialized downloaders first, with the generic HTML pipeline as fallback.

    Both extractors call into lxml's C extension, which is not safe to
    share across threads — running them in a ThreadPoolExecutor caused
    Fatal Python error: Aborted during pool teardown on Python 3.14
    (the workers would deadlock in shutdown's join). Serializing the
    calls eliminates the crash; the perf cost is one extra extraction's
    worth of CPU per page, which is acceptable.

    Correction to that rationale, from a later SIGABRT (core dump showed
    ``double free or corruption (out)`` in ``htmlParseDocument``): sharing an
    lxml *parser* across threads is in fact supported — lxml serializes it with
    a per-parser lock. The real hazard is the libxml2 ``xmlDict`` that threads
    adopt from a shared parser and then intern into concurrently. So
    serializing here was never the actual fix, and it could not have been:
    it only covers two extractors within ONE page, while the corruption comes
    from different pages extracted in different threads. The real fix is
    per-thread parsers — see ``utilities.lxml_thread_safety``, installed at
    this module's import. This sequencing is retained because it is harmless
    and the Python 3.14 teardown deadlock above was a separate problem.
