"""Safe loading of on-disk FAISS indexes.

LangChain's ``FAISS.load_local(..., allow_dangerous_deserialization=True)``
deserializes the ``<index>.pkl`` docstore companion with a raw
``pickle.load`` (see ``langchain_community/vectorstores/faiss.py``). Pickle
executes arbitrary code during deserialization, so a tampered ``.pkl``
dropped into the index directory yields arbitrary code execution when the
index is next loaded.

The ``.faiss`` and ``.pkl`` files are loaded independently with no
cross-check, so a content checksum over only the ``.faiss`` file (which is
what the file-integrity system records) provides **no** protection against a
``.pkl``-only swap. Rather than gate the dangerous load behind a checksum,
this module removes the dangerous deserialization entirely: it replicates
``load_local`` but unpickles the docstore through a restricted unpickler that
only permits the two classes a legitimate FAISS docstore contains
(:class:`InMemoryDocstore` and :class:`Document`). Any other global
(``os.system``, ``subprocess.Popen``, a crafted ``__reduce__`` payload, …)
raises :class:`pickle.UnpicklingError` before it can execute.

The payload is the 2-tuple ``(docstore, index_to_docstore_id)`` written by
``FAISS.save_local``; the metadata it carries is plain JSON-ish scalars
(str/int/float/bool/None/list/dict), none of which require a class global to
unpickle. If a future LangChain/Pydantic version changes the on-disk format
to need additional classes, loading fails closed (a clear error) rather than
silently — and the round-trip test in
``tests/vector_stores/test_faiss_safe_load_security.py`` will catch it so
the allow-list can be widened deliberately.

# Subclass the PURE-PYTHON unpickler (``pickle._Unpickler``), NOT the default
# C ``pickle.Unpickler``. We need to override ``get_extension`` to refuse the
# copyreg extension opcodes (EXT1/EXT2/EXT4), and only the pure-Python unpickler
# routes those opcodes through an overridable ``get_extension`` method — the C
# unpickler resolves them internally. (Why ``get_extension`` and not just
# ``find_class``: both unpicklers normally route EXT through ``find_class`` on a
# cold cache, but ``get_extension`` short-circuits on a warm process-global
# ``copyreg._extension_cache`` and skips ``find_class`` entirely. Refusing
# ``get_extension`` outright closes that path regardless of cache/registry
# state, instead of relying on the extension registry happening to be empty.)
# ``_Unpickler`` has been the stable pure-Python name since Python 3.0; if a
# future runtime drops it, this fails loudly at import (caught by tests) rather
# than silently falling back to the C unpickler.
