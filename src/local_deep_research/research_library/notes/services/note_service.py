           ``get_notes_collection_id`` and never commit; the request
           teardown ROLLS BACK the shared session, discarding the row
           after its id was already returned to the client.

        Because the commit flushes the caller's whole session, callers

        session and is used by ``restore_with_bookends`` which has
        explicitly chosen to reparse outside its restore transaction

        ``link_overrides`` (lowercased link text → target_document_id) lets
        a caller bind a specific ``[[text]]`` to an exact target id.
        ``accept_suggested_link`` passes it so a suggestion accepted for one
        of several same-titled notes links to THAT note — not whichever the
        title resolver happens to pick.
