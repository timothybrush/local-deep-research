"""Vector-store provider registry and factory.

Mirrors ``embeddings/embeddings_config.py``: a flat list of valid providers, a
lazily-populated class registry, and a single resolution entry point. Only
FAISS is registered today, and there is no settings key selecting a provider
yet — ``resolve_provider`` always returns ``"faiss"``. The seam exists so a
future backend is a bounded addition (register the class, add a setting) rather
than a rewrite of the call sites.
