        per-site ``remove_think_tags`` / ``get_llm_response_text`` calls on
        fresh ``invoke``/``ainvoke`` results; they are redundant and hide
        bugs. (Exceptions: ``.stream()``/``.astream()``, ``with_config``,

        ``__getattr__``, as do injected/unwrapped LLMs — those may still need

        text-only, and the ``<think>...</think>`` artifact is only ever
        emitted as plain text by some local models. Non-string content
        (e.g. provider content-block lists like Anthropic's, or ``None``)
