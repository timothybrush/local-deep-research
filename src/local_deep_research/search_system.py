    The LangGraph agent re-instantiates the search engine *per tool call*
    from this snapshot (``_make_web_search_tool`` -> ``create_search_engine``),
    and registering a user's document collections needs the username
    (``get_user_db_session``), which collection registration reads only from
    ``settings_snapshot["_username"]``. The snapshot is built without it (the
    user lives under ``system.user``), so without this a collection/library
    primary fails inside the agent with "Unknown search engine 'collection_…'".

    Injected here in ``AdvancedSearchSystem.__init__`` — the narrowest common
    consumer of the strategy-running paths — so the web run and the
    programmatic API are repaired in one place. (No-ops when ``username`` is
    absent, e.g. benchmarks/news, which don't use per-user collections anyway.)
    Mirrors the convention ``get_search()`` already applies to its own local
    snapshot copy.

    Returns the snapshot unchanged when there is no username, it is not a dict,
    or ``_username`` is already set (never overwrites an explicit value);
    otherwise a shallow copy with ``_username`` added (no mutation).
