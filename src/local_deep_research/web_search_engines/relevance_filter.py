"""LLM-based relevance filter using plain text output.

Filters search previews by asking the LLM to return a list of relevant
indices as plain text (e.g. ``0, 2, 5``). We parse the response with a
regex over integers, which is robust to wrappers like "Indices: 0, 2"
or "[0, 2, 5]" and dodges all the structured-output provider quirks
(qwen prose-mode, function_calling latency, schema bikeshedding).

Design notes:
- An empty LLM response is treated as a valid judgment ("none of these
  results are relevant"). We do not second-guess the model — if the
  filter says reject all, we reject all, and log a warning so users
  can notice if their chosen model is misbehaving.
- On exception (network error, parse failure, provider outage) the
  filter is considered unavailable, not "reject all". In that case we
  fall back to a capped slice of the original previews so downstream
  processing is not overwhelmed by unfiltered results.
- The filter can split large preview lists into smaller ``batch_size``
  chunks. Smaller batches are faster per call and tend to be more
  reliable on weaker models which struggle to track many indices in a
  single context. A failed individual batch is skipped (logged); only
  a hard exception falls back to the capped slice.
- Partial success is the common outcome under batching: some batches
  return valid judgments, others raise or time out. Successful batches
  are kept; failed/timed-out batches contribute nothing. The capped
  fallback only fires when *every* batch failed to produce a result.
