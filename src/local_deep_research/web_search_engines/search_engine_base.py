    Abstract base class for search engines with two-phase retrieval capability.

    Subclass contract for ``__init__``
    ---------------------------------
    Concrete engines should forward ``settings_snapshot`` and
    ``programmatic_mode`` to ``super().__init__`` so the base class can wire
    them up correctly. The cleanest way is to declare ``**kwargs`` and pass
    it along::

            super().__init__(max_results=max_results, **kwargs)

    Many existing engines accept ``**kwargs`` but don't forward — that
    silently drops ``programmatic_mode`` (and used to bind the wrong rate
    tracker). The factory has a post-construction safety net that calls
    ``_configure_programmatic_mode`` when the engine's mode doesn't match
    what the caller asked for, but new engines should not rely on it: the
    safety net only covers ``programmatic_mode``, not ``settings_snapshot``
    or other base kwargs.
