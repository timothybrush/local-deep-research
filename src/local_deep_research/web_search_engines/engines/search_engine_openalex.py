        scientific engine needs: its ``self.api_key`` belongs to another

        ``Authorization`` header, so the latch alone would leave the
        refused credential live for its *searches*.

        That matters when the DOI enrichment pass is the path that learns
        the key is bad — a search that returned 200 followed by an
        enrichment 401, e.g. a key revoked mid-run. Enrichment's
        ``on_key_rejected`` callback is this method; without the drop
        below the next search on the same instance would send
        ``Authorization: Bearer <refused key>`` again.

        ``self.openalex_api_key`` first, so whenever this engine has a
        key the enrichment pass sends that same string.

        Idempotent, and safe in either order relative to
        :meth:`_drop_rejected_api_key`: the base method keeps the stored
        literal with ``or self._rejected_api_key``, and clearing an
        already-cleared attribute or popping an absent header is a no-op.
