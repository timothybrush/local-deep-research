"""Shared rate limiter for SearXNG engine instances.

The research agent constructs a fresh `SearXNGSearchEngine` for every
tool call, so the previous per-instance `last_request_time` only
throttled requests on engines that were explicitly reused (for example
the shared engine used by `JournalReputationFilter` for Tier 4). This
module provides a process-wide tracker keyed by SearXNG ``instance_url``
so the configured ``delay_between_requests`` actually applies across
per-call engine instances.

The locking pattern mirrors other per-key locks in the codebase
(see ``database/backup/backup_service.py`` and
``database/encrypted_db.py``): a meta-lock guards lazy creation of a
per-URL lock, and that per-URL lock guards updates to the timestamp.

Note on memory:
`MAX_TRACKED_URLS` is an eviction target, not a hard bound: the tracker can
grow while all existing locks are held. At capacity, evictable entries are
removed under `_meta_lock`. Each URL has exactly one tracked `_UrlState` carrying both
its lock and its timestamp (#5688), so a timestamp write is an attribute
write on a reference the caller already holds -- it cannot recreate an
entry eviction has removed, the way writing into a *second*, separately
keyed map could.
