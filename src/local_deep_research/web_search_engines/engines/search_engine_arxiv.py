        equation-preserving official arXiv HTML rendition when one exists,
        then the arXiv PDF, and never the API metadata leg that
        ``download_text_with_source`` would add. That replaces the pypdf
        extraction this engine used to inline.

        The downloader is imported lazily: importing
        ``research_library.downloaders.arxiv`` at module scope would
        pull the whole download stack into every engine import, and
        its base module imports back into
        ``web_search_engines.rate_limiting``.

        The downloader fetches from ``export.arxiv.org``, the host arXiv
        sets aside for programmatic access, rather than ``arxiv.org``.

        Returns the text only when it is full text: the HTML rendition or
        text extracted from the PDF. Returns ``None`` when arXiv answered
        that the paper has no full text (no usable rendition, and no PDF
        bytes). The downloader handles its own transport errors on every
        leg (HTTP errors, 429s, connection failures and the decoded-body
        cap all come back as a status, not as an exception), which this
        method turns into the exceptions below. The API metadata leg is
        never requested (``download_full_text``): it yields the abstract,
        which the engine already holds as the paper summary, so it would
        add an arXiv API request without adding text.

        Raises ``FullTextNotExtractedError`` when the PDF arrived but
        produced no text (an image-only scan, or the extraction ceilings
        hit first), ``FullTextRateLimitedError`` when arXiv answered the
        PDF request with HTTP 429 or 503 (the PDF leg makes one attempt
        and does not retry), ``FullTextFetchFailedError`` when a request
        failed instead of being answered (timeout, connection error, 5xx,
