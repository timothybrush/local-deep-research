    Two triggering cases, both handled identically by callers:

    1. A live thread already exists in the active-research dict for this
       ``research_id`` — typically a retry after a prior attempt's
       post-spawn ``UserActiveResearch`` commit failed.
    2. The ``ResearchHistory.status`` is non-QUEUED (``IN_PROGRESS`` from
       a prior attempt's pre-spawn commit that succeeded; terminal
       ``COMPLETED`` / ``FAILED`` / ``SUSPENDED`` from a thread that
       already finished and cleaned itself out of ``_active_research``).
       Re-spawning would either contradict the live thread or re-run a
       finished research.

    Callers that wrap the spawn in ``except Exception`` to clean up orphan
    state on spawn failure MUST catch ``DuplicateResearchError`` separately
    *before* that generic branch and re-raise / return without mutating the
    research's status or deleting the ``UserActiveResearch`` row — those
    rows belong to the live thread, and marking them FAILED terminates a
    running thread from the user's perspective while it keeps executing.
