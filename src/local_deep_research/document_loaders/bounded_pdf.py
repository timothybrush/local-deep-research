"""Bound PDF text extraction for byte-backed document loaders.

RAG uploads and Zotero sync both call ``extract_text_from_bytes``. The
registry's ``PyPDFLoader.load()`` materializes text from every PDF page, so
those entry points need the same ceilings as the other extraction paths.
Pypdf still flattens the page tree before the first page is yielded, and one
``extract_text()`` call cannot be interrupted without process isolation.
