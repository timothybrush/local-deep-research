"""Stop openpyxl from reading chartsheet drawings (images and charts).

``.xlsx`` text extraction goes unstructured ``partition_xlsx`` ->
``pandas.read_excel`` -> ``openpyxl.load_workbook(read_only=True)``.
Even in read-only mode openpyxl loads every chartsheet's drawing via
``openpyxl.reader.drawings.find_images``, which calls
``archive.read(target)`` once **per image reference** and keeps every
copy (and parses a chart part once per chart reference). One image
entry referenced N times therefore costs N times its size: a ~100 KB
upload can pin gigabytes, which no per-entry ceiling can bound.

Images and charts contribute no text, and this application uses
openpyxl only to extract text, so the reader's drawing hook is replaced
with one that returns nothing. That removes the per-reference reads at
their source instead of trying to count references in attacker-written
XML. (Worksheet drawings are only read outside read-only mode, which
this path never uses.)

The patch is **process-wide and permanent**: once the first ``.xlsx``
upload is processed, every openpyxl workbook loaded anywhere in this
process has no images or charts. Nothing else in the application reads
workbooks with openpyxl; anything added later that needs drawings must
load them some other way.
