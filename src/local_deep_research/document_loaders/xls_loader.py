"""Custom loader for legacy ``.xls`` (BIFF) spreadsheets.

``unstructured``'s Excel partitioner runs a ``msoffcrypto`` "is encrypted?"
pre-check on every workbook. That check crashes on some legacy ``.xls`` files
(``struct.error: unpack requires a buffer of 4 bytes`` in its xls97 record
reader) even though ``xlrd`` reads the same file fine. To make ``.xls`` uploads
extract reliably, this loader reads the workbook directly with pandas + xlrd
and bypasses that pre-check. Modern ``.xlsx`` files still use the unstructured
loader, whose OOXML path is unaffected.
