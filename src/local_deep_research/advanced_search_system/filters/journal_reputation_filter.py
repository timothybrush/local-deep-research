"""
Journal reputation filter with tiered quality scoring.

Scores journals 1-10 and filters academic search results by quality.
Uses bundled bibliometric data for most journals; LLM analysis is an
opt-in last resort.  Predatory journals are auto-removed.

Scoring tiers (tried in order, first match wins):

  1. Predatory check — auto-removes blacklisted journals/publishers
                       (whitelist override prevents false positives)
  2. OpenAlex        — h-index, quartile, DOAJ from ~217K bundled sources;
                       preprint repos can be lifted via institution affiliations
  3. DOAJ            — quality floor (5) for listed OA journals
  3.5 Institutions   — author affiliation lookup when no venue matched
                       (capped at 6, never beats a real venue)

  --- DB cache check (only for cached LLM results from previous runs) ---

  3.6 LLM cleanup    — LLM canonicalises the name, then retries Tier 2
                       (opt-in via ``enable_llm_scoring``)
  4. LLM analysis    — SearXNG web search + LLM scoring (opt-in, expensive);
                       disabled after 2 consecutive failures
  Conference         — name-pattern heuristic for unmatched conferences

Unknown journals that no tier can score receive a low-confidence score (3).

        Score a journal using the tiered approach.

        - ``score`` is the 1-10 quality value, or ``None`` if the
          journal is predatory (signal to auto-remove).
        - ``source_tag`` identifies which tier produced the score:
          ``"openalex"``, ``"doaj"``, ``"institution"``, ``"llm"``
