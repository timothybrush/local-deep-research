For the research query: "{query}"

PROGRESS: Processing source {i + 1} of {total_sources} ({sources_remaining} remaining)

TARGET DISTRIBUTION:
- Total sources to organize: {total_sources}
- Current topics: {current_topics}
- Ideal balance: ~{ideal_topics} topics with ~{ideal_sources_per_topic} sources each
- {"Too many topics - prefer adding to existing ones" if current_topics > ideal_topics else "Can create new topics if needed" if current_topics < ideal_topics else "Good balance - be selective"}

GUIDELINES:
- Aim for balanced distribution: ~{ideal_sources_per_topic} sources per topic
- Prefer adding to existing topics when there's a clear thematic match
- Only create a new topic if the source represents a distinctly different aspect
- Consider: Topics with <{ideal_sources_per_topic // 2} sources need more sources; topics with >{ideal_sources_per_topic * 1.5:.0f} sources are getting full
- Avoid overloading: If a topic has {ideal_sources_per_topic * 2}+ sources, consider if the new source might better start a related subtopic
- Use "d" ONLY for sources that are COMPLETELY UNRELATED (e.g., wrong topic entirely, spam, or error pages). When in doubt, keep the source!

CURRENT SOURCE TO CATEGORIZE:
Title: {source.get("title", "Untitled")}
URL: {source.get("link", "")}
Snippet: {source.get("snippet", "")}

EXISTING TOPICS (showing source count):
{existing_topics_str}

Respond with:
- Use "-" to create a new topic
- Use topic number (0-{len(topics) - 1}) to add to existing topic
- Add "+" after the number if this source could be a better lead for that topic
- Use "d" to delete ONLY if source is about a completely different subject (not just low relevance)

Examples: 0, 2+, -, 1, 3+, d

3. Is different from previous questions
4. Stays within the scope of the original query
5. Is concise and searchable (max 15 words)

Based on the topic sections above, write ONE comprehensive introductory paragraph that:
1. DIRECTLY ANSWERS the research question by synthesizing insights from ALL topic sections
2. Focuses on the main answer to the question first
3. Integrates key findings from the different topics into a coherent response
4. Uses citations [1], [2], etc. for specific claims

IMPORTANT: Focus on ANSWERING THE QUESTION directly using the information from the topic sections.
