class SourceBasedSearchStrategy(BaseSearchStrategy):
    """
    Source-based search strategy: iterative question generation → parallel search → final synthesis.

    ## High-level flow (analyze_topic):

    1. **Iteration loop** (default 5 iterations, configurable via `search.iterations`):
       - Iteration 1: uses the original query + LLM-generated questions
       - Iterations 2+: LLM generates follow-up questions using accumulated search results
         as context (the [-N:] most recent, configurable via `search.question_context_limit`)
       - All questions for an iteration are searched in parallel via ThreadPoolExecutor
       - Results are appended to `accumulated_search_results_across_all_iterations` (local var)

    2. **Cross-engine filter** (after all iterations):
       - If enabled (default): filters/reorders/reindexes accumulated results for relevance
       - If disabled: uses all accumulated results as-is
       - Result is `final_filtered_results`

    3. **Citation & synthesis**:
       - `final_filtered_results` are extended into `self.all_links_of_system` (shared list)
       - `citation_handler.analyze_followup()` synthesizes content with citation numbers
       - Citation numbers are offset by `total_citation_count_before_this_search` so they
         continue from previous analyze_topic() calls (important for detailed reports)

    ## Key invariant — `self.all_links_of_system`:

    This list is the SAME object as `AdvancedSearchSystem.all_links_of_system` (passed by
    reference via constructor, see search_system.py:195). It is the single source of truth
    for citations in the final report.

    In detailed report mode, `IntegratedReportGenerator` calls `analyze_topic()` multiple
    times (once per subsection). Each call EXTENDS this shared list with its own results.
    Previous sections' results are never touched or re-filtered — they persist safely.

    The final report's Sources section is generated from this list at report_generator.py:494.
