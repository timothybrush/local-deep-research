Break down the original question into 2-5 simpler sub-questions that would help answer the original question when answered in sequence.
Follow these guidelines:
1. Each sub-question should be specific and answerable on its own
2. Sub-questions should build towards answering the original question
3. For multi-hop or complex queries, identify the individual facts or entities needed
4. Ensure the sub-questions can be answered with separate searches

Format your response as a numbered list with ONLY the sub-questions, one per line:
