"""Switch default search.time_period from 'y' to 'all'.

Background
==========
``search.time_period`` shipped with a default of ``"y"`` (Past year). With
issue #4936 the Tavily engine learned to honor this setting (forwarding it
to the Tavily ``time_range`` param), which exposed a long-standing problem:
the same default also drove the already-wired ``serpapi`` and ``wikinews``
engines, silently filtering every default search to the last year. For
research and news that is sometimes desirable, but as an *immutable* default
it quietly hides older (often more authoritative) sources, and most users
inherited it without choosing it.

The new default ``"all"`` disables the time filter unless the user opts in
(Past 24 hours / week / month / year), matching the intuitive meaning of
"search the web".

What this migration does
========================
Updates rows where ``key = 'search.time_period'`` AND the stored value is
exactly ``"y"``. Users who explicitly chose ``d``, ``w``, ``m``, or ``all``
are left untouched. Users who deliberately picked ``y`` will find their
preference flipped — they can re-select ``Past year`` from the settings UI;
this is the intentional cost of fixing a poor default that almost everyone
inherited without choosing it.

Storage note: the ``value`` column uses SQLAlchemy's ``JSON`` type, which
serializes Python strings via ``json.dumps`` and stores them as TEXT. The
on-disk representation of the string ``y`` is the 3-character literal
``"y"`` (with the surrounding quotes), so the WHERE clause matches on that
exact form.
