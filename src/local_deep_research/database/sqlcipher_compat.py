    SQLite 3.51.0/3.51.1 can invert its inode and global VFS mutexes when a
    WAL connection closes while another connection opens. In sqlcipher3,
    close() also holds the GIL, so the whole interpreter can stop. Serialize
    these two native entry points for the affected POSIX builds; statements
    and transactions continue to run concurrently. SQLite fixed the mutex
    order in 3.51.2 (see the official 3.51.2 release notes). Leaving WAL
    mode closes the WAL the same way; see ``wal_lifecycle_guard``.

    A guarded connection closes under the guard even when another thread
    finalises it. To make that possible it is opened without the driver's
    own thread check. When the caller asks for ``check_same_thread`` (the
    driver default), the wrapper raises the driver's ProgrammingError for
    the connection methods the driver checks, for setting
    ``isolation_level`` to None (which commits), and for cursors from the
    default cursor factory. A blob is checked only when opened.

    Only opens and closes made through this function are serialized.
    ``ATTACH DATABASE`` opens a file and ``DETACH DATABASE`` closes it inside
    a statement, outside the guard. On the affected builds, attaching or
    detaching a file while another thread opens or closes the same file
    through this function can still deadlock; attaching a different file
    does not contend. The application attaches only its temporary backup
    file, which no other connection opens while it is attached.

    Explicit custom factories retain their own construction/cleanup behavior.
    Application connections use the default driver Connection factory.
