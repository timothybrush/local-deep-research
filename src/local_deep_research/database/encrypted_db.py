    Called from ``create_user_database``'s failure paths. The encrypted
    branch writes a per-database ``.salt`` file (via ``create_database_salt``)
    *before* the DB itself, and SQLCipher/WAL leaves ``-wal``/``-shm``
    sidecars. Removing only the ``.db`` — as these cleanup paths used to —
    orphans the ``.salt``: a retry then hits ``create_database_salt``'s
    ``FileExistsError`` (it refuses to overwrite to prevent data loss), so the
    username stays permanently un-registerable even after the orphaned auth
    row is cleaned up. Delete every artifact so the on-disk state is atomic
    and the username is reusable on a subsequent retry.

    ``create_user_database`` calls this from four sites: its three
    failure-cleanup blocks (structure creation, engine build, migration — a
    graceful error mid-creation) and its salt-creation recovery path (an
    orphan left by a prior hard-killed create or by pre-#4934 cleanup that
    removed only the ``.db``). In every case the ``db_path.exists()`` guard at
    the top of ``create_user_database`` already ran and found no *pre-existing*
    database, so any ``.db``/``.salt`` present now is this call's own partial
    work — removing it cannot destroy live data, because a valid encrypted DB
    always has both the ``.db`` and its ``.salt``.

    Both the ``-wal``/``-shm`` (WAL mode, the default) and ``-journal``
    (rollback-journal modes: DELETE/TRUNCATE/PERSIST) sidecars are removed so

        #
        # We use QueuePool (pool_size=20, max_overflow=40,
        # pool_timeout=10) for production and StaticPool for tests.
        #
        # Why pool_size=20:
        #
        # 1. SQLCipher + WAL mode can leak file handles when connections
        #    close out of open-order. Fewer pooled connections = fewer
        #    opportunities for out-of-order closes during pool_recycle.
        #    See: https://github.com/sqlcipher/android-database-sqlcipher/issues/6
        #    See: https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/35010
        #
        # 2. SQLite serializes all writes through a single file lock.
        #    Multiple pooled connections don't improve throughput — they
        #    just hold FDs (up to 3 per connection in WAL mode).
        #
        # 3. The cleanup scheduler periodically calls engine.dispose()
        #    to release all pooled connections, preventing long-lived
        #    handles from accumulating over days of idle operation.
        #
        # Why pool_size=20 and not 1: inject_current_user() creates a
        # QueuePool session on every request via g.db_session. With the
        # UI polling /api/research/<id>/status every 1-2s plus other
        # API calls and before_request middleware, pool_size=1
        # (max_overflow=2, so 3 total) is easily exhausted — causing
        # 30-second timeouts and PendingRollbackError cascades.
        # pool_size=20 + max_overflow=40 (60 total) provides ample
        # headroom for concurrent requests and multiple browser tabs.
        #
        # Why not NullPool: SQLCipher's PRAGMA key adds ~0.2ms per
        # connection open. With 20-30 queries per page load, NullPool
        # adds a noticeable 4-6ms overhead vs QueuePool's ~1.5ms.
