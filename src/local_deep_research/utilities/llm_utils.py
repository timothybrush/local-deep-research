    The identifier is used as a cache key: `Journal.quality_model` records
    which LLM scored a cached journal, and the lookup predicate filters on
    it so scores from a superseded model don't get served.

    Discovery order:
      1. Unwrap `ProcessingLLMWrapper` (or any wrapper exposing `.base_llm`)
         so we key on the underlying model, not the wrapper identity.
      2. Prefer `model_name` (some LangChain classes). Then `model`
         (ChatOpenAI, ChatAnthropic, ChatOllama use this). Fallback to the
         class name so we never return an ephemeral `repr(object)` that
         poisons the cache.

    Returns a plain string; never None. Values written by `getattr(llm,
    "name", str(llm))` in earlier versions (e.g. `"<ProcessingLLMWrapper
    object at 0x…>"`) naturally miss this cache and re-score once.

def _close_base_llm(llm):
    """Close per-instance HTTP clients on a raw LLM or embeddings instance.
    Internal use only.

    Applies to every ``langchain_ollama`` class — ``ChatOllama``,
    ``OllamaLLM``, and ``OllamaEmbeddings`` all carry the same
    ``_client`` / ``_async_client`` shape, eagerly constructed at instance
    init by a Pydantic ``@model_validator(mode="after")``. ``ChatAnthropic``
    and ``ChatOpenAI`` use ``@lru_cache``'d shared httpx clients that must
    NOT be closed; the ``ollama``-module check below short-circuits cleanly
    for them. Same skip applies to local providers like
    ``HuggingFaceEmbeddings`` / ``SentenceTransformerEmbeddings`` (no
    per-instance httpx client at all).

    Each Ollama class owns both ``_client`` (sync ``ollama.Client`` wrapping
    ``httpx.Client``) and ``_async_client`` (async ``ollama.AsyncClient``
    wrapping ``httpx.AsyncClient``). Async paths via ``ainvoke()``
    (exercised by browsecomp_entity_strategy, llm_driven_modular_strategy,
    modular_strategy) leak the async transport per call if only the sync
    side is released — investigated in #3816 where ~72% of leaked FDs were
    ``a_inode [eventpoll]`` selectors bound to those async clients. The
    same shape reappeared for embeddings after the langchain_community →
    langchain_ollama migration (#4352/#4353); see the resource-cleanup doc
    for the post-mortem.

    Idempotent via an ``_ldr_closed`` sentinel on the inner httpx clients.

    The async path always runs ``aclose()`` to completion: when no event
    loop is currently running we use ``asyncio.run()`` directly; when a
    loop is running in the calling thread (e.g. ``_close_base_llm`` is
    invoked inside async code or in a ``finally`` block reached through
    LangGraph/LangChain async dispatch) we hand the close off to a brief
    daemon thread whose own ``asyncio.run()`` is unaffected by the
    caller's loop state. A prior implementation skipped the close in
    that case and relied on the "loop owner" to close — but no loop
    owner code actually does, so the ``httpx.AsyncClient`` and its
    ``epoll_create`` FD were silently leaked. See the regression history
    in ``docs/developing/resource-cleanup.md`` (this is the gap left by
    #3855 when reaching for the in-async-context close).
