Batch DOI → OpenAlex source_id enrichment.

Resolves paper DOIs to OpenAlex source IDs in a single batch HTTP request
(up to 50 DOIs per call). This populates ``openalex_source_id`` and
``source_type`` on result dicts so the journal reputation filter can look
up journals by ID rather than fragile name matching.

Runs as a pre-enrichment layer before content filters — the existing
tiered scoring system is unchanged. This just gives Tier 2 (OpenAlex
snapshot lookup) a reliable key to work with.

def normalize_openalex_api_key(api_key: Any) -> Optional[str]:
    """Normalize a configured OpenAlex API key to a real key, or ``None``.

    ``None`` means "make the request keyless" — OpenAlex works without a
    key, so an unusable configured value must degrade to the free tier
    rather than being sent as a ``Bearer`` token that earns a 401/403 and
    turns a working engine into one that returns nothing.

    Collapses to ``None``:

    * any non-``str`` value (``True``/``1`` from a mis-typed setting used
      to raise ``AttributeError`` on ``.strip()``),
    * whitespace-only values (``None``, never ``""``),
    * the ``"False"`` settings sentinel, case-insensitively,
    * every placeholder ``BaseSearchEngine._is_valid_api_key`` rejects —
      ``your-api-key-here``, ``<your_api_key>``, ``${OPENALEX_API_KEY}``, …
    * any value that is not usable as an HTTP header value. Two
      independent rules, both required:

      - *internal whitespace or control characters*. Such a value cannot
        be a real key, and a newline in it makes ``requests`` raise
        ``InvalidHeader`` whose message embeds the value's ``repr``,
        which neither scrub pass can match (the literal holds a real
        newline, the message holds a backslash and an "n"). Rejecting it
        keeps it out of the logs.
      - *not latin-1 encodable*. This is the hard constraint: CPython's
        ``http.client`` encodes every header value as latin-1
        (``values[i] = one_value.encode('latin-1')``), and neither
        ``requests``' own header validation nor anything below it gates
        the encoding. A key carrying U+2010, U+2013 or U+2019 — what a
        PDF paste or an editor's autocorrect produces — therefore raises
        ``UnicodeEncodeError`` *before any request leaves the process*.
        That is not an HTTP status, so :func:`send_with_key_fallback`
        cannot turn it into a keyless retry by inspecting
        ``response.status_code``; the value has to be refused here.
        Characters that *are* latin-1 (``é``, ``ü``) are left alone —
        they encode fine and could be part of a real key.

    This lives here, rather than next to the placeholder list in
    ``web_search_engines/search_engine_base.py``, because all three
    OpenAlex callers need it — the search engine, the base-class DOI
    enrichment pass, and the research-library downloader — and only this
    module is low-level enough for the downloader to import. The
    placeholder list itself is *not* duplicated: it is imported inside
    the function, which keeps the *module-level* import graph free of the
    engine package (``research_library.downloaders.openalex`` imports
    this module at module level).

    ``safe_requests`` allows a 1 GiB response body, and running all of it
    through the ~18 compiled patterns of the credential scrubbers only to
    keep a couple of hundred characters is pointless work. This bounds
    the *regex passes* — ``response.text`` has already decoded the whole
    body by the time it is called, so it bounds no allocation.

    Truncating before scrubbing is only safe if the cut cannot create a
    partial credential, because the scrubbers are shape-anchored and a
    scrub can *shrink* the text (``Bearer <token>`` collapses to 17
    characters), pulling content from far beyond the caller's final cap
    into the characters that get logged.

    The invariant that makes it safe: :func:`normalize_openalex_api_key`
    refuses any key containing whitespace, so a key is always contained
    in a single whitespace-free run. Cutting back to the last whitespace
    character at or before *limit* therefore drops the trailing partial
    run in its entirety — no fragment of a token that straddles the
    boundary can survive. A body with no whitespace at all in its first
    *limit* characters yields ``""``: the whole prefix is one unbroken
    run and none of it can be shown to be credential-free.

    """Send an OpenAlex request; drop a refused key and retry keyless once.

    OpenAlex serves the same endpoints with no key at all, at a lower
    daily budget (https://help.openalex.org/api/authentication/), so a
    stale, rotated, typo'd or revoked key must never cost the caller its
    results. Every LDR call site that can send the OpenAlex credential
    goes through this one function so the guarantee cannot be
    implemented in one place and forgotten in another.

    On an auth failure (:data:`OPENALEX_AUTH_FAILURE_STATUSES`) *while a
    key was actually sent*, or when the keyed send raises
    ``UnicodeEncodeError`` (see below):

    * exactly one warning is logged. It is scrub-safe by construction:
      the only interpolated values are *context* (a caller literal) and
      the integer status code — the key itself is never formatted into
      it;
    * the key is dropped. This function returns ``None`` as the key in
      effect and calls *on_key_rejected* so the caller can clear any
      cached ``Authorization`` header, which means no later request pays
      another wasted round-trip with a credential already known to be
      refused;
    * *before_retry* runs (rate-limit accounting for the extra request);
    * the same request is retried once, keyless.

    When no key was sent, or the response is not an auth failure, the
    response is returned untouched and nothing is logged — keyless
    behaviour is exactly what it was before the key existed.

    If the keyless retry fails too, its response is returned as-is and
    the caller applies its own pre-existing failure handling.

    ``UnicodeEncodeError`` from the keyed send is treated exactly like a
    rejection. It is the one exception that can only come from encoding a
    request *header value*: ``http.client`` encodes header values as
    latin-1 *before* opening the connection, so no request went out and a
    keyless resend is safe and correct. (URLs and query parameters are
    percent-encoded by ``requests`` and raise ``InvalidURL``, not
    ``UnicodeEncodeError``.) Which header is not knowable here.
    :func:`normalize_openalex_api_key` already refuses non-latin-1 keys,
    so on every in-tree path the ``Authorization`` value is already
    known-encodable and the likelier source is another configured header
    value — the contact email interpolated into the ``User-Agent``, which
    ``requests`` emits before ``Authorization``. Dropping the key is
    still the right response: it is the only credential-bearing header,
    and a keyless resend costs nothing when the key was not at fault.
    The catch is deliberately this one exception type: any other failure
    is a real network or protocol error, and retrying it keyless would
    both hide the fault and throw away a key the server never refused.

    Args:
        send_request: ``send_request(with_api_key)`` issues the request
            and returns the response. It MUST omit the ``Authorization``
            header when *with_api_key* is False.
        api_key: The key that will be sent, or ``None`` for keyless.
        context: Short literal naming the call site, for the log line.

            caller's cached credential state.
        before_retry: Called once, immediately before the retry.
