"""Caller-safe download skip-reason tokens (single source of truth).

PR #6564 follow-up: ``research_library.services.download_service`` and
``research_library.downloaders.html`` each carried their own copy of the
exception-class -> fixed-token table. The copies drifted (``DataError``,
``InterfaceError``, ``InvalidRequestError`` and the ``OSError`` errno branch
existed only on the services side), and the "mirrors" comment overstated the
parity. This module owns the table and the mapping function; both call sites
import from here so they cannot drift again.

Contract (CWE-209): never pass ``str(exc)`` to the caller. The exception text
can carry SQL text (``INSERT INTO document_collections ...``), target URLs,
or absolute file paths. Caller-visible ``skip_reason`` values are fixed
tokens or ``download_error:<ClassName>`` only. Full diagnostics stay
server-side via ``logger.exception`` and ``DownloadAttempt.error_message``.
``sanitize_error_for_client()`` is NOT a substitute — it scrubs credential
shapes only, not SQL/paths/URLs.

    Author-written constant for known classes; the exception's class name
    for everything else. Never passes ``str(exc)`` through — that can carry
    SQL text, target URLs, or file paths the caller should not see. The full
    exception text is preserved server-side via ``logger.exception`` and
    stored in ``DownloadAttempt.error_message`` only after the same safe
    mapping (see ``download_service._download_pdf``'s outer except).

    ``OSError`` is the one exception family where ``str(exc)`` is *not*
    free of app-controlled text — Python formats it as
    ``"[Errno N] <strerror>: <filename>"`` and the filename field is
    arbitrary. We can't safely pass ``str(exc)`` through. What we *can*
    safely surface is ``exc.strerror`` when it matches the OS-level
    canonical message (i.e. ``os.strerror(exc.errno)``). That string is
    provided by the OS — not by the application — so it carries no SQL,
    URL, or path content. Custom constructions like
    ``OSError(28, "leak: secret file contents")`` deliberately don't match the
    canonical message and fall through to the class-name default.
