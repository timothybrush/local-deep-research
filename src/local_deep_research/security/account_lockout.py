"""Per-user account lockout after repeated failed login attempts.

Complements the per-IP rate limiting in ``security/rate_limiter.py`` by
tracking failures at the *username* level. A user who exceeds the
configured threshold is temporarily locked out regardless of the source IP.

Note: lockout state is in-memory and per-process. In multi-worker
deployments (e.g. gunicorn), each worker maintains separate state.
