    """
    Session with built-in SSRF protection.

    Redirect validation relies on ``requests.Session.resolve_redirects()``
    calling ``self.send()`` for each hop — an internal implementation detail
    of the ``requests`` library.  This is simpler than re-implementing the
    redirect loop (as ``safe_get``/``safe_post`` do) and keeps session-level
    features (cookies, auth) working.  The trade-off is coupling to the
    ``requests`` internals; if a future version stops routing hops through
    ``send()``, redirect targets would no longer be validated.

    Usage:
        with SafeSession() as session:
            response = session.get(url)

        # For trusted internal services (e.g., searxng on localhost):
        with SafeSession(allow_localhost=True) as session:
            response = session.get(url)

        # For trusted internal services on any private network IP:
        with SafeSession(allow_private_ips=True) as session:
            response = session.get(url)

    Raises:
        ValueError: If a URL (initial or redirect target) fails SSRF
            validation, or if the response Content-Length exceeds
            MAX_RESPONSE_SIZE.  Note: ``safe_get``/``safe_post`` also raise
            ``ValueError`` for too-many-redirects, but ``SafeSession`` raises
            ``requests.TooManyRedirects`` for that case since it delegates
            redirect counting to the ``requests`` library.

    Honors the ``Retry-After`` header when present (falls back to the

    Without ``consume_body``, only failures raised inside ``safe_get``
    itself (DNS, connect, header timeout, retryable status) trigger a
    retry. The body isn't read until the caller touches ``.content`` /
    ``.text`` / ``.json()``, by which point this wrapper has already
    returned — so a mid-stream S3 hiccup (``ChunkedEncodingError``)
    propagates uncaught. ``consume_body=True`` reads the body inside
    the retry loop so those transient body-read failures are also
    retried. The cached body is still available to the caller via
    ``response.content`` after the wrapper returns.

        backoff_times: Per-attempt sleep seconds.
        consume_body: If True, read ``response.content`` inside the
            retry loop so body-read transients are retried. Use for
            large or chunk-transferred bodies (~MB+) where mid-stream
            disconnects are realistic. The body-guard's ``ValueError``
            (oversized body) is NOT retried — it propagates immediately.
        **kwargs: Forwarded to ``safe_get``.

    Returns:
        The first successful (or final-attempt) ``requests.Response``.

        is cached on the response.

            ``consume_body=True``, the body-guard rejects an oversized
