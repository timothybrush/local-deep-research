"""Sanitize raw strings before writing them to log output.

``data_sanitizer.py`` handles dict-key redaction (e.g. stripping API keys
from structured data by key name). This module handles different
concerns:

* :func:`strip_control_chars` / :func:`sanitize_for_log` \u2014 make a single
  string value safe to include in a log line by removing non-printable
  characters and truncating to a reasonable length.
* :func:`redact_secrets` \u2014 scrub known sensitive *values* (API keys,
  passwords, session tokens) from an arbitrary string before it is
  logged, returned in an error message, or persisted.
* :func:`sanitize_error_details` \u2014 recurse a structured ``details`` value
  and redact credential *shapes* from its string leaves before it is
  serialized to a client. (Value-shape based; contrast
  ``data_sanitizer.DataSanitizer``, which redacts by key *name*.)

    constructed from upstream exception messages, URLs, or other
    sources that could contain a value the caller already knows is
    sensitive.

    Each *secret* is matched as a literal substring (``str.replace``).
    The function does not normalize encodings: if a secret appears
    URL-encoded or otherwise transformed in *message*, the transformed
    form is NOT redacted unless the caller also passes that
    transformed form.

    When multiple secrets are passed, they are applied in descending
    length order so a shorter secret that happens to be a substring of
    a longer one cannot consume part of the longer match. Example:
    given secrets ``"abc12345"`` and ``"sk-abc12345"``, the longer one
    is replaced first.

            this are skipped to avoid corrupting normal message content
            (a 1- or 2-character secret would match too aggressively).
            Defaults to 8. Real API keys and session tokens are

# an `id=`, a filter) carries no credential shape yet may still be user-supplied
# text (e.g. the user's raw search query) that should not reach a log sink.
# Scoped to scrub_error() only (see below) — NOT part of sanitize_error_message,
# since that function also backs sanitize_error_for_client() — and, through it,
# sanitize_error_for_agent(), which is that helper at a 500-char cap — where
# preserving a failed request's own query string is useful for the caller
# debugging it.
#
# Scheme: RFC 3986 §3.1 is one ALPHA followed by zero or more
# ALPHA/DIGIT/+/-/. — the *lower* bound must stay 0 so a valid
# single-character scheme (``x://...``) still matches, but the
# *continuation* is capped at 31 chars (matches the sibling URL-credential
# pattern above). An unbounded ``*`` here is a measured quadratic ReDoS:
# on a message containing a long ALPHA/DIGIT/+/-/. run with no following
# "://" (e.g. a stringified response body reaching str(error)), the engine
# retries the "://" match at every run offset, backtracking the whole
# remaining run each time — O(n^2). Verified locally: unbounded, a 40k-char
# run takes ~1.5s (quadratic: ~4x per input doubling); bounded, the same
# input is back to microseconds. See test_scrub_error_is_linear_time_on_a_
# long_scheme_like_run.
#
# URL body (authority + path, up to the "?"): excludes whitespace, "?" and
# "#" as before, plus the double quote and angle brackets, which are never
# valid unencoded inside a URL (an HTTP client percent-encodes them), and is
# capped at 4096 chars. Both are needed for the same reason the scheme
# continuation is bounded: without them, ``[^\s?#]+`` followed by ``\?`` is a
# second quadratic path — on a whitespace-free run dense in "://" (a
# minified JSON list of URLs, a stringified response body) the engine
# consumes to the end of the run at every "://" and backtracks the whole
# remainder looking for a "?" that never comes. Measured on the uncapped
# body: ~1s at 36k chars, ~4s at 72k, ~16s at 144k (4x per doubling), against
# milliseconds before the query pass existed. Excluding the quote makes the
# common JSON shape short per URL, and the cap bounds every other shape. A
# URL whose scheme+authority+path exceeds 4096 chars has its query left
# alone — no engine in this codebase builds one, and over-length is not a
# leak vector the way a redaction gap is. See
# test_scrub_error_is_linear_time_on_a_dense_url_run.
#
# Query stop-set: whitespace plus the wrappers a URL appears inside in
# prose/logs (a markdown link's ``)``, a quote) so the redaction doesn't
# consume past the URL's actual end and corrupt the surrounding message
# (e.g. eating a markdown link's closing paren, or swallowing a second,
# unspaced adjacent URL's own leading scheme once the first URL's wrapper is
# reached). ``]`` and ``}`` are deliberately NOT in the stop-set: this pass
# runs after sanitize_error_message, whose credential-shaped redaction emits
# ``[REDACTED]`` / ``[REDACTED_KEY]`` in place of a value, and a stop-set
# containing ``]`` halted the strip at that marker — so every parameter
# AFTER a credential-shaped one (Google PSE's ``key=...&cx=...&q=<query>``,
# ScaleSERP's ``api_key=...&q=<query>``) survived into the log while looking
# scrubbed. A URL inside square brackets is now over-redacted up to the
# closing bracket, which is the safe direction. Requires >=1 char (``+``,
# not ``*``): a bare trailing "?" with nothing after it is not a query at
# all, so a sentence-final "...page? yes" must not be rewritten into
# "...page?<redacted> yes", which would imply a query existed.

    scrubbing runs FIRST, on the full untruncated string, so a secret near
    the ``max_length`` boundary cannot be split by truncation and slip past
    the regexes.

    Scope, because it is easy to over-trust: this removes credential

    endpoints or dependency internals. Use it on a message an author already
    knows to be safe apart from a possible embedded secret — not as a filter
    that makes an arbitrary exception safe to show.

    Where an exception can carry those other kinds of detail, do not pass its
    text through here at all. Two worked examples, and they are NOT the same
    technique:

    * ``web/routers/rag.py``'s ``_format_test_embedding_error`` withholds the
      text entirely — it uses the exception's module and class only to SELECT
      one of a fixed set of messages, and interpolates neither.
    * ``web/routers/zotero.py``'s ``_zotero_error_response`` forwards text,
      but only text that is already one of the package's author-written
      constants: ``client_safe_zotero_message`` looks ``str(exc)`` up in
      ``CLIENT_SAFE_ZOTERO_MESSAGES`` and returns the module constant it
      found (or the caller's own fallback literal), so the value in the
      response never comes from the exception object.

    Keep the detail server-side. ``logger.exception`` is the default, but it
    is not unconditional: loguru's ``diagnose`` renders every frame-local in
    an attached traceback, so in a handler whose frames hold credentials (an
    API key, the SQLCipher password) log without the traceback instead —
    ``logger.warning(scrub_error(exc, *known_secrets))``. See the Zotero sync
    handler in ``research_library/zotero/sync_service.py`` and the
    credential-frame handlers in ``web/queue/processor_v2.py``. Only the
    stderr sink can have ``diagnose`` on, and only behind two explicit
    opt-ins (``utilities/log_utils.py``), but that is exactly the
    configuration an operator debugging such a failure runs.

    serialized to a client (e.g. ``NewsAPIException`` / ``WebAPIException``).
    This is the *value-shape* counterpart to :class:`data_sanitizer.DataSanitizer`,
    which redacts by *key name*; use this one when the concern is a credential
    embedded anywhere in the text, regardless of the key it sits under.

    Behaviour by node type:

    * ``dict`` — recurse into values; ``str`` keys are also run through
      :func:`sanitize_error_message` (a credential used *as* a key would
      otherwise ship verbatim as a JSON key). Two distinct keys that both
      redact to the same token collapse to one entry — an acceptable
      fidelity loss for the pathological case of credential-shaped keys.
    * ``list`` / ``tuple`` — both rebuilt as a plain ``list``: the payload is
      about to be JSON-serialized (a tuple already becomes a JSON array), and
      rebuilding via ``type(value)(<generator>)`` would raise on a namedtuple /
      tuple subclass whose constructor is not ``(iterable) -> instance`` —
      inside a Flask error handler that degrades a structured error into a bare
      500.
    * **dataclass instance** — converted via ``dataclasses.asdict`` and recursed.
      Flask's default JSON provider serializes a dataclass (via ``asdict``), so
      without this a credential in a dataclass field would ship un-redacted.
    * ``str`` leaf — redacted via :func:`sanitize_error_message` (credential-shape
      redaction only — no length cap or control-char strip, so structured values
      such as IDs survive).
    * anything else (ints, bools, ``None``, and any other object) — passed
      through untouched. Note some passthrough types (``set``/``frozenset``,
      ``bytes``, a non-``str``-mixin ``Enum``) are not JSON-serializable, so a
      credential inside them fails *closed* at ``jsonify`` (generic 500) rather
      than leaking.

    Redaction is shape-based, so it never removes a value by key name — a benign
    ``{"query": "reset my password"}`` is unchanged. Containers are rebuilt fresh
    (the input is not mutated); passthrough leaf objects are returned by
