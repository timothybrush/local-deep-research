"""Sanitize raw strings before writing them to log output.

``data_sanitizer.py`` handles dict-key redaction (e.g. stripping API keys
from structured data by key name). This module handles different
concerns:

* :func:`strip_control_chars` / :func:`sanitize_for_log` \u2014 make a single
  string value safe to include in a log line by removing non-printable
  characters and truncating to a reasonable length.
* :func:`redact_secrets` \u2014 scrub known sensitive *values* (API keys,
  passwords, session tokens) from an arbitrary string before it is
  logged, returned in an error message, or persisted.
* :func:`sanitize_error_details` \u2014 recurse a structured ``details`` value
  and redact credential *shapes* from its string leaves before it is
  serialized to a client. (Value-shape based; contrast
  ``data_sanitizer.DataSanitizer``, which redacts by key *name*.)

    constructed from upstream exception messages, URLs, or other
    sources that could contain a value the caller already knows is
    sensitive.

    Each *secret* is matched as a literal substring (``str.replace``).
    The function does not normalize encodings: if a secret appears
    URL-encoded or otherwise transformed in *message*, the transformed
    form is NOT redacted unless the caller also passes that
    transformed form.

    When multiple secrets are passed, they are applied in descending
    length order so a shorter secret that happens to be a substring of
    a longer one cannot consume part of the longer match. Example:
    given secrets ``"abc12345"`` and ``"sk-abc12345"``, the longer one
    is replaced first.

    Args:
        message: The string to scrub. Returned unchanged if falsy.
        *secrets: Zero or more candidate secret values. ``None`` and
            values shorter than *min_length* are silently skipped \u2014 the
            caller is responsible for noticing missing config.
        min_length: Minimum secret length to redact. Values shorter than
            this are skipped to avoid corrupting normal message content
            (a 1- or 2-character secret would match too aggressively).
            Defaults to 8. Real API keys and session tokens are

    Behaviour by node type:

    * ``dict`` — recurse into values; ``str`` keys are also run through
      :func:`sanitize_error_message` (a credential used *as* a key would
      otherwise ship verbatim as a JSON key). Two distinct keys that both
      redact to the same token collapse to one entry — an acceptable
      fidelity loss for the pathological case of credential-shaped keys.
    * ``list`` / ``tuple`` — both rebuilt as a plain ``list``: the payload is
      about to be JSON-serialized (a tuple already becomes a JSON array), and
      rebuilding via ``type(value)(<generator>)`` would raise on a namedtuple /
      tuple subclass whose constructor is not ``(iterable) -> instance`` —
      inside a Flask error handler that degrades a structured error into a bare
      500.
    * **dataclass instance** — converted via ``dataclasses.asdict`` and recursed.
      Flask's default JSON provider serializes a dataclass (via ``asdict``), so
      without this a credential in a dataclass field would ship un-redacted.
    * ``str`` leaf — redacted via :func:`sanitize_error_message` (credential-shape
      redaction only — no length cap or control-char strip, so structured values
      such as IDs survive).
    * anything else (ints, bools, ``None``, and any other object) — passed
      through untouched. Note some passthrough types (``set``/``frozenset``,
      ``bytes``, a non-``str``-mixin ``Enum``) are not JSON-serializable, so a
      credential inside them fails *closed* at ``jsonify`` (generic 500) rather
      than leaking.

    Redaction is shape-based, so it never removes a value by key name — a benign
    ``{"query": "reset my password"}`` is unchanged. Containers are rebuilt fresh
    (the input is not mutated); passthrough leaf objects are returned by
