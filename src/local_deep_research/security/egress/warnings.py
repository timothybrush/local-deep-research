"""Egress-policy warning checks.

Pure functions: take primitive values, return a warning dict or ``None``.
These surface on the research-form banner so users can see at a glance
when their current policy lets data leave the machine.

The audit identified three independent vectors that each deserve their
own banner:

1. **Public search egress enabled** — the active scope permits any public
   engine to fire. The default scope ``adaptive`` can resolve to a
   public-allowing posture, so this fires on a fresh install too; suppressed
   via the dismiss flag so first-launch isn't a wall of red.
2. **Cloud LLM enabled** — the user hasn't opted into
   ``llm.require_local_endpoint`` and the configured provider is one of
   the unambiguously-cloud providers. Critical-severity because the
   user's full prompt content leaks on every research run.
3. **Cloud embeddings enabled** — even worse: indexing a corpus with
   OpenAI embeddings POSTs every chunk to OpenAI. Critical-severity.
