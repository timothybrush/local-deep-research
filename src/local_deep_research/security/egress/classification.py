"""Two-axis egress data classification — ADR-0007, rollout stage A.

Pure decision logic. Each model a run touches (search engine, collection /
store, LLM, embeddings) is classified on two **orthogonal** axes:

* **Sensitivity** — of the data the component *sources*: must it never leave the
  machine?  (``SENSITIVE`` / ``NON_SENSITIVE``)
* **Exposure** — of the *sink* the component represents: does sending data to it
  put that data off-machine?  (``EXPOSING`` / ``CONTAINED``)

:func:`evaluate_run` decides whether a *set* of classified components may run
together, per the four-quadrant rule in ADR-0007. The core invariant: **a run
may not let a SENSITIVE source reach an EXPOSING sink.** Because an agentic run
can turn one engine's results into another engine's query (the LangGraph
silent-expansion bug class already in our threat model), the rule is evaluated
over the whole component set, not per individual call.

This module holds the pure decision logic. It is consumed via
``run_classification``, which resolves live engines/providers, assembles a run,
and — at the run-start precheck — **enforces** the decision (rejecting a run
that would let a sensitive source reach an exposing sink), except under the
``UNPROTECTED`` escape hatch where it evaluates permissive. See
``docs/decisions/0007-egress-two-axis-data-classification.md``.
