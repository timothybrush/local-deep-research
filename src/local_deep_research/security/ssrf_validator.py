      carries a port (for the last two, ``localhost`` and IP literals
      excepted): the shape a userinfo holding one of those delimiters
      leaves behind (``https://tok/en@host/`` parses to the netloc
      ``tok``, ``https://user:12#34@host/`` to ``user:12``,
      ``https://john.doe:1234/x@host/`` to ``john.doe:1234`` and
      ``https://admin:P@ss.example#1@host/`` to ``admin:P@ss.example``).
      See ``authority_may_be_userinfo``, which ``redact_url_for_log``
      and ``rate_limit_authority`` share.

    Residual: see ``authority_may_be_userinfo`` -- a dotted username
    directly followed by the delimiter (``https://john.doe/x@host/``) is
    returned as parsed.
