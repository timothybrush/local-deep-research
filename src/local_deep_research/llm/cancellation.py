"""Cooperative cancellation for in-flight LLM calls.

Research, chat and other long-running operations run on worker threads that
block inside a synchronous LangChain ``llm.invoke()``.  Setting the
termination flag (``web.research_state.set_termination_flag``) only takes
effect at the *next* ``check_termination`` checkpoint — i.e. after the
current LLM HTTP request finishes, which can be minutes on a slow local
model.  The worker therefore keeps burning GPU/API budget after the user
clicks Stop.

This module is the single place that maps a ``research_id`` to "should this
LLM call abort now?".  Wrappers (``config.llm_config.ProcessingLLMWrapper``
and the rate-limiting wrapper) resolve the effective research id from:

1. an explicitly bound id (``bind_llm_to_research`` / ``research_id`` ctor
   arg — survives thread-pool hops where the ContextVar is not copied), or
2. the current thread's search context (``utilities.thread_context``), so
   LLMs created without an explicit id inside a research worker are still
   covered.

When an id is known, wrappers prefer a streaming implementation of
``invoke``: they consume ``base_llm.stream()`` chunk by chunk, check the
flag between chunks, and close the generator on abort.  Cancellation
latency drops from "full response time" to "time to next token".  Closing
the generator releases the underlying HTTP response promptly instead of
leaving it to GC.
