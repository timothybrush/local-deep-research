# Note: wheel>=0.46.2 is required for CVE-2026-24049 fix (path traversal)
# Note: Scorecard's Pinned-Dependencies rule additionally wants per-package

# layer but rejected it: hash-locking pip itself has repeatedly broken
# rebuilds (mirror/wheel-tag drift across CI runs). The base image's pip is

# three resulting Scorecard alerts (#7740, #7741, #7742) are dismissed as
# won't-fix; revisit if a stable hash-locking workflow becomes available.
# Note: the 26.1.2 bump fixes CVE-2026-8643 (path traversal via malicious
# entry point name in wheel installation); CVE-2026-1703 (fixed in 26.0) and
