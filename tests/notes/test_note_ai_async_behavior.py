"""Behavioral proof that the notes AI endpoints are genuinely async (#5854).

The notes AI tranche (PR #6232) exists to return AnyIO worker threads to
the pool for the length of each model response. These tests demonstrate
that property end-to-end through the REAL FastAPI app — not by inspecting
code, but by observing runtime behavior:

1. ``test_ai_call_runs_on_the_event_loop_thread`` — the awaited AI call
   executes as a coroutine on the event-loop thread, never on a pooled
   worker thread. Under the old sync-def model the whole handler (LLM
   call included) ran ON a worker thread; the thread identity of the
   stub call is the observable difference.

2. ``test_concurrent_ai_requests_overlap`` — several AI requests with a
   slow stub complete in roughly one stub duration, not the sum. If each
   request still serialized on a worker thread — or worse, blocked the
   event loop — the wall time would be the sum.

3. ``test_sync_route_stays_responsive_while_ai_requests_in_flight`` —
   the issue's own measure of done, in route form: with MORE AI requests
   in flight than the process's ~40 AnyIO worker tokens (45 here, each
   parked on a 1.5s stub), a plain sync-def route (``/api/v1/health`` —
   served from that same worker pool) still answers immediately. Under
   the old model, 45 sync AI handlers would pin every worker token and
   the health route would queue behind them.

Harness notes (mirrors test_notes_router_fastapi.py):
  * The real app is driven through ``httpx.AsyncClient`` + ``ASGITransport``
    so requests can genuinely overlap on one event loop — the synchronous
    ``TestClient`` processes one request at a time and cannot express
    these scenarios. No lifespan runs (same as the sync harness).
  * A real register + login mints the encrypted-DB session the notes
    routes require; ``NoteAIService`` is monkeypatched with a recording
    stub whose async methods sleep to simulate the model hold.
  * The client fixture disables rate limiting for these throughput tests
    so the concurrency batches do not trip the 10/min AI bucket.
