"""Cross-user IDOR regression guards for the notes feature.

LDR is a multi-user app: each user has their own encrypted SQLite
database, and the per-user DB session is the structural isolation
primitive (Document rows have no user_id column). These tests guard
that primitive — if a future refactor causes NoteService to route
queries to a global / wrong-user session, the assertions here flip.

``tests/notes/`` previously had no cross-user coverage. This file
closes that gap with one targeted test per surface — both reads
(get / version read / list / outgoing-links / backlinks) and writes
(update / delete) — so a future refactor that introduces a
per-method routing bypass gets caught at the right call site.
