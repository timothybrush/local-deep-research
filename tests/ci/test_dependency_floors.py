"""Revert-catching tests for the patched-v2 dependency floors.

Why these exist: the security floors in ``pyproject.toml`` ship in the
published wheel metadata, but nothing downstream re-asserts them — pip only
checks resolvability (2.32.x still resolves), and OSV scans ``pdm.lock``,
which already held patched versions before the floors existed via dev
overrides. Lowering or deleting a floor is therefore a silently revertible
change. Each test fails loudly when its floor moves, and names the
advisories the floor remediates so a future re-baseline must justify itself
here rather than in a diff nobody reads.
