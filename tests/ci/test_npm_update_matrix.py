"""Tests for the dynamic npm-update matrix in update-npm-dependencies.yml.

Coverage in two layers:

1. Structural ("guardian") tests parse the workflow YAML and pin the wiring
   that makes the matrix dynamic: the ``discover`` job, its ``matrix``
   output, the ``update`` job consuming
   ``fromJson(needs.discover.outputs.matrix)``, the ``set -euo pipefail``
   and empty-matrix guard, the minimal ``contents: read`` permission,
   ``fail-fast: false`` on the per-directory legs, the create-pull-request
   branch template's well-formed ``${{ matrix.npm_directory.slug }}``
   expression (the slug is computed once in discover's jq and threaded
   through the matrix — it is no longer re-derived in the update job), and
   the fail-loud invalid-slug and slug-collision guards in discover. These
   prevent the safety features from being silently removed — same philosophy as
   ``tests/ci/test_release_gate_integrity.py``.

2. Behavioral tests extract the discover step's real ``run:`` script from the
   YAML and execute it against synthetic fixture trees via subprocess. This
   proves the find|jq pipeline produces a correct matrix (repo root builds,
   ``tests/*`` dirs skip, excluded dirs ignored, a "slug" computed per entry)
   and that the empty-matrix, unknown-path, invalid-slug, and slug-collision
   guards all fail the job loudly — without duplicating the pipeline, so it
   cannot drift from the workflow.

    """Assert ``slug`` yields a valid git ref when appended to the branch.

    Pure Python on purpose — it lets the test run without invoking
    ``git`` for every candidate slug. This encodes the subset of its
    rules a slug can actually violate: the slug is a *suffix* of
    ``update-npm-dependencies-{run_number}-``, so rules about a ref
    component's first character (a leading ``-`` or ``.``) cannot apply,
    but ``..``, a trailing ``.``, and a ``.lock`` suffix all can — and all
    three pass a bare ``[A-Za-z0-9._-]+`` charset check. A dir named
    ``tests/foo.lock`` or ``tests/a..b`` would slug cleanly and then fail
    in create-pull-request. Git's syntax checker also permits a branch that
    is too long for the runner filesystem to create with its temporary
    ``.lock`` suffix, so the policy caps slugs at 200 ASCII bytes.

    Deliberately *stricter* than git in three ways. An empty slug and a
    slug containing ``/`` both yield refs git would accept, but both mean
    the transform is broken (an empty slug collapses every leg onto one
    branch; a surviving ``/`` is the one character the transform exists to
    remove). Beyond that the charset itself is conservative: git accepts
    plenty of bytes it excludes (``+``, ``,``, ``@``, ``|``, non-ASCII
    such as ``café``), so a lockfile dir using them would trip this
    assertion despite producing a valid branch. That is the intended
    trade-off — such a dir should be renamed rather than have the guard
    loosened.

    The production discover step enforces the same policy in jq. The
    behavioral invalid-directory fixtures below execute that real script so
    this Python mirror cannot be the only effective guard.
