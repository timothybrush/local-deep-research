"""
Tests verifying that the FastAPI ``require_auth`` dependency rejects
unauthenticated requests correctly across the URL shapes the app actually
exposes.

Guards two things:

* Page routes (e.g. ``/news/``, ``/news/subscriptions``) redirect
  unauthenticated callers to the login page.
* API routes — including nested paths like ``/news/api/...`` —
  return a JSON ``401`` instead of an HTML redirect. This is the
  regression case that motivated ``_is_api_request`` matching ``/api/``
  anywhere in the path, not only as a top-level prefix.

Ported from the pre-FastAPI Flask ``@login_required`` test. The decorator
was replaced by the ``require_auth`` dependency
(``local_deep_research.web.dependencies.auth``); the JSON-vs-redirect
negotiation moved into the global HTTPException handler registered by
``local_deep_research.web.fastapi_app._register_exception_handlers``
(``_is_api_request`` is the successor of the old ``_is_api_path``). We wire
both REAL pieces here against synthetic routes that mirror production URL
shapes, so a regression in either the dependency or the handler surfaces.

The real news/research routers pull in heavy optional dependencies
(langchain, pdfplumber, etc.) and are exercised elsewhere. Here we only
care about the auth gate's behavior at each URL shape.

Note: the FastAPI/Starlette HTTPException JSON body uses the ``detail`` key
(``{"detail": "Authentication required"}``), not Flask's ``{"error": ...}``.
