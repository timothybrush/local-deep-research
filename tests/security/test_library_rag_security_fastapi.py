"""Security coverage for the library / RAG surface lost in the Flask ->
FastAPI migration (PR #3299).

The migration deleted ``tests/research_library/`` (21 paths, 682 tests) while
porting all four blueprints 1:1 into ``web/routers/{library,rag,
library_delete,library_search}.py``. A provenance audit of those deletions
found five security-flagged behaviours that survived in ``src/`` but lost
every assertion that pinned them. This file re-pins exactly those five, at
the layer where the contract actually lives.

COVERAGE AREA 1 -- note-protection 403 on ``DELETE /library/api/document/{id}``.
    Guard: ``research_library/deletion/services/document_deletion.py``
    ``_delete_document_locked`` -> ``_is_note_document`` -> ``is_note: True``,
    mapped to 403 at ``web/routers/library_delete.py::delete_document``.
    At the ADR-0010 snapshot, no direct assertion covered this route: the
    branch's service test
    (``tests/research_library/deletion/services/test_document_deletion.py::
    TestDocumentDeletionServiceNoteRefusal``) covers only ``delete_blob_only``
    and ``remove_from_collection``, and its own docstring defers the
    ``delete_document`` case to the route suite this PR deleted. A regression
    lets a note Document be hard-deleted (and bulk-amplified) through the
    generic document API, bypassing NoteService's version/link cleanup.

COVERAGE AREA 2 -- the 403-vs-404 mapping on the two sibling delete routes,
    ``DELETE /library/api/document/{id}/blob`` and
    ``DELETE /library/api/collection/{cid}/document/{did}``. The service-level
    refusals were covered by the branch test named above; the status mapping
    was not. The tests below now pin that mapping because a refusal surfaced as
    404 instead of 403 is a different contract (the frontend uses the
    distinction to route the user to the notes API).

COVERAGE AREA 3 -- ``web/routers/rag.py::_format_test_embedding_error``.
    At the review snapshot it had no direct assertions (11 predecessor tests
    were deleted); this file now pins its branches. This is the CWE-209 error
    boundary on
    ``POST /library/api/rag/test-embedding``: the function's output goes
    straight into the response body. Three branches matter -- internal LDR,
    upstream provider, and unexpected failures. Every branch returns a fixed
    category message because exception text can carry filesystem paths, SQL,
    response bodies, or credentials.
    ``tests/web/routers/test_rag_hostile_input.py::
    test_test_embedding_does_not_leak_decoder_message`` covers only the
    malformed-body 400, which returns before this function is ever reached.

COVERAGE AREA 4 -- ``web/routers/rag.py::_sanitized_indexing_errors``. Its
output is
    stored in ``TaskMetadata.result_metadata`` by both terminal paths of
    ``_background_index_worker`` and read back by the index-status / SSE
    endpoints, i.e. it reaches the browser. Unscrubbed per-document errors are
    a disclosure; an unbounded list is a response-size problem.

COVERAGE AREA 5 -- ``research_library/utils/is_downloadable_domain``. It had no
    direct coverage at the review snapshot; the tests below and
    ``tests/web/routers/test_library_download_outcomes.py`` now cover it. It is
    the
    allowlist gate deciding which remote URLs
    the server will fetch (``web/routers/library.py:879``, ``:1539`` and
    ``:1766``), so it is SSRF-adjacent. The tests below pin the policy the implementation and
    its docstring actually describe -- "academic domain OR direct PDF link" --
    and deliberately pin the remaining CURRENT-BEHAVIOUR weaknesses (plus the
    regressions closed by ``harden: reject private hosts in
    is_downloadable_domain, anchor the PubMed rule``) rather than inventing a
    stricter policy (see ``TestIsDownloadableDomainKnownWeaknesses``).
    ``TestIsDownloadableDomainPrivateHostNormalization`` separately pins the
    call-site-only IP-literal normalization (trailing dot, decimal/hex,
    shorthand-dotted, per-octet octal, RFC 6598 CGNAT) added on top of that
    hardening -- see that class's docstring for why the shared
    ``is_private_ip()`` helper itself is untouched.

Harness: the ``auth_client`` idiom from
``tests/web/routers/test_library_delete_hostile_input.py`` -- a real,
in-process ``TestClient(app, raise_server_exceptions=False)`` against the live
FastAPI app, a freshly registered and auto-authenticated throwaway user, a real
CSRF token (CSRF is ASGI-middleware-enforced, not a config flag), a per-test
``LDR_DATA_DIR``, and a distinct ``X-Forwarded-For`` so the per-IP limiter
cannot bucket these clients together. No network, no LLM.

Non-vacuity: every "the forbidden thing is absent" assertion is paired with a
positive assertion that the *expected* content is present. An empty library or
a 500 would otherwise satisfy "no filesystem path in the response" trivially.
