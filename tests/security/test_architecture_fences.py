"""Architecture fences: the invariants cross-user safety rests on.

Two invariants argued during the OpenWebUI-advisory mapping were
assertions, not contracts. These tests pin them -- and run the *same*
scanner scripts the pre-commit hooks run, invoked the way pre-commit
invokes them (repo-root cwd, repo-relative paths), so the hook and the
contract cannot drift:

1. **Per-user isolation (smoke check)**: every construction of a
   user-data service/session under the routers, ``research_library/``
   and ``web/services/`` passes a username-named argument explicitly.
   Where that username came from (it must be the ``require_auth``-derived
   one) is enforced for router call sites by
   tests/security/test_cross_user_isolation_census.py, not here.
2. **Web-layer file-serving references are fenced**: report artifacts
   land in an install-shared directory whose cross-user safety rests on
   root confinement, no path disclosure, and no serving route. Any
   ``FileResponse`` / ``StaticFiles`` / ``StreamingResponse`` reference
   (or star import) under ``web/`` outside the hook's per-file
   ALLOWED_FILES is flagged; LDR's serving wrappers
   (``WorkerCleanupStreamingResponse``) must be handed a same-module
   generator call; and a serving call referencing the outputs directory
   inline is flagged everywhere, allowlisted files included.

Plus: ``_generate_report_path`` (currently without production callers)
yields collision-free names, as preventive hardening for the shared
directory.
