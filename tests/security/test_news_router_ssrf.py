"""The live news router must validate custom_endpoint and subscription_id.

Ported from ``tests/security/test_news_live_blueprint_ssrf.py`` on
``origin/main`` (#5603), which the FastAPI migration deleted. The module it
guards moved ``news/flask_api.py`` -> ``web/routers/news_flask_api.py`` and
the blueprint became an ``APIRouter``; the guards themselves survived, and
the merge that produced this branch had to *re-add* the third write path's
guard (``update_subscription_folder``) after an earlier state of the port
dropped it. So the guard has already been lost once here, silently, with no
test to say so.

At the time of writing nothing on this branch references
``_reject_custom_endpoint``, ``_is_valid_uuid`` or ``NO_SUBSCRIPTION_FILTER``:
deleting all three call sites from the write routes turns no test red.
``tests/security/test_llm_endpoint_link_local_hardening.py`` unit-tests the
shared ``is_safe_custom_llm_endpoint`` predicate, and
``tests/web/routers/test_start_research_ssrf.py`` pins it on a *different*
route — neither notices if the news routes stop calling it. That is precisely
the failure shape #5603 existed to prevent (a working guard on a copy nobody
routes to), so as on main the wiring is pinned by driving real HTTP through
the router the app actually mounts, not by inspecting source.

Deviations from the original, all forced by the runtime:
* ``_reject_custom_endpoint`` returns a ``JSONResponse`` (or ``None``) rather
  than Flask's ``(body, status)`` tuple, and needs no app context.
* Authentication is ``Depends(require_auth)``; the FastAPI-native way to say
  "this client is logged in" is ``dependency_overrides``, replacing main's
  ``session_transaction()`` poke.
* ``TestClient`` follows redirects by default where Flask's client did not,
  so every request below passes ``follow_redirects=False``.
