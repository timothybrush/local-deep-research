"""UUID shape fences on parameterized page routes.

``_validated_collection_id`` (rag.py) established the pattern: page
routes that interpolate a path parameter into templates must validate
the id's *shape* at the boundary, because collection/note/document ids
are server-generated UUID4 strings — anything else is a typo or an
injection attempt, and shape validation is strictly more robust than
fixing any one template context (it covers inline-JS interpolation,
``onclick`` handlers, and anything added later).

This change fences two page routes:

* ``GET /notes/{note_id}`` renders the page for *any* string — the raw
  id reaches the template context (``window.noteId = ...``), currently
  contained only by ``| tojson`` escaping in that one template.
* ``GET /library/document/{document_id}/chunks`` queries before any
  shape check — malformed ids already 404 via the missing-row path,
  but only after a needless DB roundtrip and without the boundary
  guarantee the collection fix documents.

The fence does not close the class: other page routes still pass a
raw path parameter into template contexts unfenced —
``GET /chat/{session_id}`` and the library document pages
``GET /library/document/{document_id}`` and
``GET /library/document/{document_id}/txt``. None is a known live
vulnerability (autoescaped attribute contexts, the same containment
tier the fenced routes are triaged at); they remain to be fenced.

These tests pin the fence: malformed ids (including script-payload
shapes) get a 404 from both page routes, while well-formed UUIDs keep
rendering exactly as before — and the source-inspection test below
fails if either fence call is silently reverted.

    A bare status-code check cannot tell the two apart: the
    missing-row branch also answers 404 (``rag.py``:
    ``return HTMLResponse("Document not found", status_code=404)``).
    If the fence call were ever moved after the DB query, a
    status-code-only test would stay green while silently losing the
    "skips its DB roundtrip" guarantee.

    This test originally pinned which branch answered by *body*: the
    fence's 404 arrived as the plain ``"Not found"`` text and the
    missing-row 404 as ``"Document not found"``. That premise changed
    when the branded error pages landed on main (PR #5424): the
    fence's ``HTTPException(404, ...)`` is dispatched by exact status
    code to ``fastapi_app.py``'s ``@app.exception_handler(404)``,
    which now renders ``templates/pages/error.html`` for browser
    requests, so the old plain-body pin went stale and failed CI on
    every branch. Body discrimination is fragile in both directions
    (the missing-row branch could be branded the same way later), so
    the test is body-independent now: it spies on the session factory
    the route resolves at call time and asserts NO DB session was
    created for a hostile id. Nothing else in this request's path
    opens a user session through that seam (``require_auth`` checks
    the connection and the server-side session without it), so a
    recorded call means the fence did not answer first. The
