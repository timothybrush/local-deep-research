"""Rekey kills held credentials: stale engines and sessions die at REKEY.

Incident context (PR #5596): the fix's ``change_password`` comment
explains why it evicts the cached engine inside the try -- the engine's
creator closure "still derives the OLD hex key, so any freshly pooled
connection is mis-keyed" (encrypted_db.py::change_password). Round 3
pinned the
inverse property (an engine survives its own ``close_user_database``
because the creator closure reconnects with the SAME pre-derived hex key
-- "resurrection", by design). This file pins the complement the incident
threat model needs:

    resurrection-after-CLOSE works (same key material, file unchanged);
    resurrection-after-REKEY dies (same OLD key material, file REKEYED).

* P1 a live engine E1 and a Session S obtained with the old password die
  on use after ``change_password(old -> new)`` (HMAC failure), while the
  file stays readable with the NEW password and ``open(old)`` is None;
* P2 ordering: a session that already survived a close (round 3's
  resurrection) must still die once a rekey lands -- the closure's stale
  key is not healed by close/reconnect cycles, only by a rekey-aware
  reopen;
* P3 a lingering dead session does not poison the manager: caches stay
  clean and paired, new-password opens work, wrong-password opens fail
  closed, and close_all + reopen still reads the canary.
