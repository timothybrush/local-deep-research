"""Planted journal artifacts and the crafted super-journal unlink class.

Research context (SQLite bug forum 2026 disclosure; sqlite.org/fileformat
§rollback journal): a crafted hot ``-journal`` whose header names a
"super-journal" (master journal) pathname can make a read-write opener
UNLINK that pathname during journal finalization -- i.e., an attacker
with data-directory write access can aim an arbitrary-file deletion at
any path the process may unlink. Related class from sqlite.org/
howtocorrupt.html: planting journal/WAL artifacts belonging to a
DIFFERENT database.

Probed and pinned against the real manager (all HOLD on this build):

* AI1 crafted super-journal: a journal carrying the real magic + a
  plausible header + an out-of-directory super-journal name is consumed
  harmlessly on open -- the SENTINEL file at the named path survives,
  the open succeeds, and no engine/verifier anomalies occur. (The
  crafted header's checksum is invalid, so SQLite discards it as a stale
  journal; a fully checksum-valid super-journal header would be needed
  to exercise the deletion path itself -- see the summary's scope
  note.)
* AI2 a REAL hot journal stolen from another user's database (captured
  mid-transaction in journal_mode=DELETE) and planted next to a closed
  target: the databases are persistent WAL-mode (journal_mode lives in
  the db header), so the rollback journal is not consulted at all --
  the target opens, reads ONLY its own canary, and the other user's
  secret is nowhere.
* AI3 garbage ``-wal`` bytes planted before open: SQLite's WAL-header
  checksum fails, the file is treated as invalid and reset -- the open
  succeeds, the target reads its own canary, nothing else appears.
