"""Security coverage for the settings surface lost in the Flask -> FastAPI
migration (PR #3299).

The migration deleted ``tests/web/routes/test_settings_routes*.py`` (7 files,
~330 tests) while porting the blueprint into ``web/routers/settings.py``. The
historical review summarized by ADR-0010 identified four behaviors that
survived in ``src/`` but lost their direct assertions. This file is the
committed regression evidence for those four areas.

COVERAGE AREA 1 -- model-discovery egress policy on
``GET /settings/api/available-models``
    (6 deleted tests). This route reads STORED PROVIDER CREDENTIALS and contacts
    provider model-listing endpoints, so ``_resolve_model_discovery_policy``
    and ``_model_discovery_provider_allowed`` (both in
    ``web/routers/settings.py``) are the gate that decides whether a user's
    API key leaves the box. At the review snapshot, only the
    ``settings_unavailable`` 503 arm had coverage
    (``tests/security/test_strict_policy_settings_snapshots.py::
    test_model_discovery_rejects_query_failure_before_cache_provider_or_credential``);
    the scope-refusal arms, the private_only cache filter, the remote-URL
    "local" provider and the mixed-DNS deny-before-credential-read all had
    none. Every deny test here is paired with an allow counterpart -- without
    one, a route that refused *everything* would score green.

COVERAGE AREA 2 -- secret write-back / echo redaction (6 deleted tests). Two
contracts:
    a setting held secret must never be echoed back in a response, and writing
    the redaction sentinel (or an empty string) back must be a no-op rather
    than storing the sentinel as the value. ``tests/web/routers/
    test_settings_api.py`` already covers the single-key PUT no-op
    (``test_put_empty_secret_is_noop``) and the GET redaction + sentinel
    round-trip (``test_sensitive_setting_get_is_redacted_and_roundtrip_safe``);
    this file covers only what that file does NOT -- the two BULK endpoints,
    the no-JS form POST, the ``ui_element != "password"`` sensitive-suffix
    asymmetry, the bulk-save RESPONSE echo (the
    ``"settings"`` key of ``_save_all_settings_sync``'s response, a payload
    nothing on the branch reads), and secret redaction surviving the ``LDR_*``
    env overlay on both branches of ``GET /settings/api/{key}``.
    Post-conditions are asserted against the STORED DB ROW, not the API read
    -- the API read is redacted, so it cannot tell "secret preserved" from
    "sentinel persisted over the secret", which is the exact bug these guards
    exist to prevent.

COVERAGE AREA 3 -- the non-editable-setting 403 on
``PUT``/``DELETE /settings/api/{key}``
    (the ``if not db_setting.editable`` branch of
    ``_api_update_setting_sync`` / ``api_delete_setting``). The two nearest
    branch tests pass
    vacuously: ``test_settings_env_lock_403.py::TestEnvLockedSettingReturns403::
    test_put_without_env_lock_is_unaffected`` asserts only that the error text
    lacks "environment-locked" (true of a 200), and
    ``test_settings_cache_invalidation.py::test_delete_invalidates`` sets
    ``existing.editable = True`` so it never reaches the branch. Verified by
    experiment, not by reading: with the ``editable`` check disabled in BOTH
    handlers, all 12 tests across those two files still pass, while both
    refusal tests below fail.

COVERAGE AREA 4 -- ``_filter_editable_settings`` had no
    direct references under ``tests/`` at the review snapshot. It is the authz
    gate on both bulk
    write paths (``_save_all_settings_sync``, the JSON save, and
    ``_save_settings_sync``, the no-JS form save): without it any
    logged-in user can flip a non-editable global-policy flag such as
    ``app.allow_registrations`` through a bulk save. Covered here directly and
    at both call sites. The two call-site tests are defence-in-depth: with only
    the filter disabled they still pass, because ``SettingsManager.set_setting``
    carries its own ``editable`` guard (the ``if not setting.editable``
    branch of ``SettingsManager.set_setting``). Disabling
    both layers fails them, which is the property worth pinning -- the outcome
    the user sees, not one particular implementation of it.

Harness: the ``auth_client`` idiom from ``tests/web/routers/test_settings_api.py``
-- a real, in-process ``TestClient(app, raise_server_exceptions=False)`` against
the live FastAPI app, a freshly registered + logged-in throwaway user, and a
real CSRF token (CSRF is ASGI-middleware-enforced, not a config flag). The
per-client ``X-Forwarded-For`` comes from a MONOTONIC counter rather than a
random address; note this is defence-in-depth only, NOT what keeps this
module under the limit. ``settings_limit``
(``web/dependencies/rate_limit.py``) is a shared limit keyed by
``_user_key`` -- ``user:<username>`` for a logged-in request -- so a
distinct source IP buys the settings routes nothing once the throwaway user
is logged in. What actually keeps the suite green is the autouse
``limiter.reset()`` in ``tests/conftest.py``. The counter still matters for
the routes and middleware that DO bucket on client IP (the unauthenticated
register/login calls the fixture makes, and the default-key limits), where
random addresses collide across a large session and produce 429s unrelated
to the guard under test. Every setting mutated is restored in a ``finally``.
No network, no LLM:
the only outbound calls the route would make are stubbed and asserted on.

        ``PUT /settings/api/<key>`` accepting ``{"value": "<json string>"}``
        is a supported input shape -- ``_parse_json_value``

        and env var overrides arrive as raw strings"). Every write-back
        guard call site coerced the submitted value AFTER running the
        sentinel guards, so the container arm (which only fires on an
        actual ``dict``/``list``) never saw this shape: the still-string
        value fell through to the string arm, gated on the OUTER key's
        sensitivity (False here, same as the dict-shaped case above), sailed
        through untouched, and was THEN coerced into a dict carrying the
        literal sentinel -- clobbering the real secret the same way a
        dict-shaped submission did before #6201's original fix, just
        through a different encoding of the identical payload.

        The setting must be explicitly ``ui_element="json"`` for the
        string-to-dict coercion (and therefore this bug) to engage at all;
        the sibling test above lets the key default to ``ui_element="text"``,
        under which a JSON string is stored as a literal string and never

        NO test at ANY of the three call sites, even though its stated
        rationale is a secret DISCLOSURE channel.

        A dict/list value can sit on a ``number`` row -- ``ui_element`` is
        caller-supplied metadata on a new key and is never reconciled
        against the value's actual shape. Feeding a merged container to
        ``validate_setting`` there reaches ``get_typed_setting_value``'s
        bare ``float(value)``, which raises ``TypeError``; the row is then
        rejected ("Value must be a number") and the legitimate edit is
        lost.

        SCOPE CORRECTION (round 6). This test was originally written as a
        LEAK test: the ``TypeError`` handler used to log ``"Setting {key}
        has invalid value {value}"`` at WARNING -- the whole container,
        secret leaf included -- so reverting either skip disclosed the
        restored secret to the log. It went red anyway, because the leak
        was never confined to the two write-back call sites this test
        reverts: ``PUT /settings/api/<key>`` commits and then emits a
        settings-changed event, whose ``get_setting(key)`` reaches the
        same converter with the same container AFTER both skips have
        already done their job. The fix was therefore made in the
        converter (``settings/manager.py``), which no longer logs a
        setting VALUE on any path; see
        ``test_typed_value_converter_never_logs_the_value_itself`` below,
        which pins that directly. The log assertions kept here are the
        END-TO-END form of the same property -- no secret reaches the log
        through ANY of the three write routes, whatever they call -- and
        they are what caught this in the first place.

        EXACT REVERTS THIS STILL CATCHES, at all three write routes:
          * dropping the ``validate_setting`` skip -- the container is
            rejected as "Value must be a number", so the PUT/bulk calls
            below stop returning 200/302 and the final ``stored ==``
            assertion loses the edit; and
          * reinstating the setting value in either of the converter's
            two WARNING lines -- the leak assertion below fires again.

        What this test does NOT catch, and where that coverage lives: a
        coercion-only revert on a NUMERIC row is invisible here.
        ``coerce_setting_for_write`` returns the submitted value unchanged
        when a numeric conversion fails (see its ``numeric_ui and coerced
        is None`` branch), so the stored row is identical either way, and
        the converter no longer logs anything incriminating. The coercion
        skip is pinned instead by the four
        ``..._is_not_coerced_to_str`` / ``..._does_not_leak`` tests above,
        on "text"/"textarea" rows -- the shape where coercion actually
        does damage, because ``str()`` flattens the merged container to a
        Python repr carrying the restored secret in the clear.

        The POSITIVE CONTROL is not optional: the package disables its own
        loguru namespace at import, so "no secret in the captured lines"
        would pass even if nothing was ever captured. The control asserts a
        known router WARNING from the same routes, in the same capture
        block, did arrive.

        ``test_reconciled_container_on_a_number_row_is_never_logged`` above
        covers the three write routes. It still went red, because a FOURTH
        path reaches the same converter with the restored container and is
        not a write-back call site at all:
        ``PUT /settings/api/<key>`` calls ``set_setting(...)`` with no
        ``commit=`` argument, which defaults to ``commit=True``, so
        ``SettingsManager.set_setting`` commits and then calls
        ``_emit_settings_changed([key])`` -> ``get_setting(key)`` ->
        ``get_typed_setting_value``. On a ``number``/``range``/``slider``
        row holding a dict, ``_parse_number``'s bare ``float(value)``
        raises ``TypeError`` and the handler logged the whole container --
        restored secret included -- at WARNING. The bulk routes pass
        ``commit=False`` and never emit, which is why only the PUT path
        tripped it and only the leak assertion failed.

        Skipping the converter at a fourth call site would have been
        whack-a-mole: ``_validate_imported_setting_value`` reaches it too,
        and so does any future reader. The fix is that
        ``get_typed_setting_value`` no longer logs a setting VALUE at all
        -- a settings value is, by this PR's own premise, a plausible
        secret carrier. This test pins the converter directly, so it fails
        if the value is ever reinstated in EITHER of that function's two
        warning lines, whichever route happens to reach it.
