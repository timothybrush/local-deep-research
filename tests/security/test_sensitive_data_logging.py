# allow: no-sut-import — guardian; greps history_routes.py source to keep sensitive data out of logs
"""Tests for sensitive data logging changes in history_routes.

Verifies that PR #1896 changes are in place:
- logger.debug used instead of logger.info for research detail lookups
- Request headers are not logged
- Request URL is not logged
- Full research query results are not logged

The Flask `web/routes/history_routes.py` blueprint was deleted in
the FastAPI migration; the equivalent live module is now
`web/routers/history.py`. Update the path accordingly so this
defensive lint still applies to the new code.
