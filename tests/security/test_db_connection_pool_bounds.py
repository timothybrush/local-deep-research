"""Pool bounds under concurrency and get_session racing close.

Incident context (PR #5596): the shared per-user engine is the trust
boundary -- every Session handed out by ``get_session`` /
``create_thread_safe_session_for_metrics`` binds to the ONE
credential-verified engine (ADR-0004: QueuePool, pool_size=20,
max_overflow=40). Two behavioral properties complete the picture the
incident tests left open:

* T1 concurrent readers through the shared engine: many threads reading
  simultaneously never exceed the pool's configured bounds
  (checked-out <= pool_size + max_overflow, parsed from
  ``engine.pool.status()`` snapshots taken INSIDE the threads) and never
  fail;
* T2 ``get_session`` racing ``close_user_database``: get_session is a
  pure cache lookup under ``_connections_lock``; when it wins the race it
  binds a Session to the live engine, and when the close wins first the
  round-3 resurrection contract covers the Session (the creator closure
  reconnects with the same key) -- so every session the racer obtains
  must still execute real table reads successfully, never raise, and the
  engine/verifier pairing must hold at every sampled instant.

FD-count deltas are deliberately NOT asserted here: pyproject.toml's
``fd_canary`` marker documents that ``/proc/self/fd`` assertions are
noisy under parallel execution (and ``/proc`` is Linux-only), while this
file belongs in the parallel lane for the pool/pairing coverage above.
