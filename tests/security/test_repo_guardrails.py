    .gitignore has a `.*` / `.*/` catch-all that ignores every dotfile and
    dot-directory. A `!` re-include (negation) for a dotfile placed BEFORE
    that catch-all is a DEAD rule: the later catch-all re-ignores it. Such a
    file stays tracked only if it was committed before the catch-all existed
    (git never ignores an already-tracked path), which masks the bug until a
    NEW matching file — a fresh `.gitkeep`, a `.semgrep/rules/*` rule, a
    nested `.gitignore` — is silently dropped by `git add`. See PR #4922.

    Two complementary checks:
      * ``test_dotfile_negations_are_after_catch_all`` — a fast, deterministic,
        false-positive-free *structural* guard for the exact recurring bug: a
        LITERAL dot-component negation placed before the catch-all.
      * ``test_known_paths_remain_trackable`` — a *git-semantics* guard on
        the concrete regression targets, which also catches dead negations the
        structural check can't (deleted negation, later re-ignore, missing
        parent-dir re-allow).

    Scope of the structural check (intentional limits — the git check above
    backstops the known targets): it does NOT flag a glob negation that also
    matches a dotfile (``!*.env`` — git's wildmatch has no FNM_PERIOD, so
    ``*``/``?``/``[`` match a leading dot too), because flagging every
    ``*``-leading negation would wrongly trip legitimate ones like ``!*.js``.
    A general ``git check-ignore``-over-every-negation approach was prototyped
    and rejected: this repo's broad-ignore + per-type/dir "enabler" negations
    (``!*/``, ``!.github/``, ``!*.js`` …) make per-negation and per-tracked-file
