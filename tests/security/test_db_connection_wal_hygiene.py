"""WAL hygiene at close_user_database.

Incident context (PR #5596): at-rest security of these databases depends
on what sits next to them on disk. ``close_user_database`` runs
``_checkpoint_wal`` (``PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)``,
encrypted_db.py::_checkpoint_wal) before ``engine.dispose()``, so pending
writes are flushed into the main .db and the WAL sidecars can be cleaned
up rather than left holding data indefinitely. This file pins the
observable file-level contract:

* S1 while the engine is open and has written, WAL mode is actually on
  (``PRAGMA journal_mode`` == "wal") and the -wal/-shm sidecars EXIST;
  after ``close_user_database`` the sidecars are GONE (SQLite removes
  them on the final connection close once the WAL is checkpointed and
  empty -- pinned empirically); a reopen with the correct password reads
  the canary, proving the checkpoint lost nothing;
* S2 failed wrong-password opens never grow or create WAL sidecars:
  with the user WARM (sidecars present mid-open) and with the user
  CLOSED (sidecars absent), repeated wrong-password attempts leave the
  sidecar set and byte sizes exactly as they were.

Round 1's test_db_connection_cold_open_artifacts.py fingerprinted failed
opens against a CLOSED user for the whole file set; S2 differs by
targeting sidecar bytes in both the warm (sidecars-present) and closed
states, and S1 is a new property entirely.
