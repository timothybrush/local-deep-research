"""Unencrypted fallback mode: the documented plaintext risk surface.

Incident context (PR #5596): the verifier machinery only means something
when there IS a credential to verify. In unencrypted mode
(``has_encryption == False``) the code DOCUMENTS that the cold path opens
the plain-SQLite database with any password and that the cache hit trusts
directly (``_cached_engine_trusted`` short-circuits; see its docstring
and ``test_password_verifier_primitive.py``). This file pins that whole
surface as ACTUAL, DOCUMENTED behavior -- not as a bypass -- by forcing
``has_encryption = False`` in a process that has sqlcipher3 installed
(monkeypatching ``DatabaseManager._check_encryption_available`` before
construction, per the round-5 instructions):

* U1 the full plaintext flow: create -> engine; the .db file is readable
  with VANILLA sqlite3 (no key) -- the at-rest risk, pinned; any password
  opens; change_password returns False with its "Cannot change password"
  warning (encrypted_db.py::change_password); and get_session works;
* U2 ``check_database_integrity`` on a HEALTHY unencrypted database
  must report True. It reported False until #6376: ``PRAGMA
  cipher_integrity_check`` on a plain-SQLite connection returned a closed
  result whose iteration raised ResourceClosedError, which the method's
  bare ``except`` swallowed into False. The method now skips the
  SQLCipher-only pragma when ``has_encryption`` is False, so this is a
  plain regression test.

A U3 "wrong password against a warm cache succeeds" test was dropped: it
duplicated ``test_login_cached_connection_password_extra.py``'s
``test_unencrypted_mode_reuses_cached_engine``.

``tests/database/test_sqlcipher_missing.py`` covers the import-level
RuntimeError / env-var gating of entering this mode; this file covers the
manager-level behavior once inside it. Each test builds its own manager
with the patch in effect (U3) and closes it in teardown.
