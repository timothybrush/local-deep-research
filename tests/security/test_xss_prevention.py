"""
XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) Prevention Tests

Tests that verify user inputs are properly escaped and sanitized
to prevent XSS attacks in web templates and API responses.

Ported from the pre-FastAPI Flask version: Flask's ``create_app`` +
``flask_app.test_client()`` are replaced by the FastAPI app
(``local_deep_research.web.fastapi_app:app``) + ``fastapi.testclient.TestClient``.
The Jinja2 auto-escaping checks now read the shared ``Jinja2Templates``
environment (``local_deep_research.web.template_config.templates.env``), which
is the real environment every page render goes through — so this still
exercises production escaping behaviour rather than a stand-in.
