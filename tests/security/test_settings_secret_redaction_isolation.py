"""The notification service URL must be redacted on the settings read paths.

`notifications.service_url` is an apprise-style URL that embeds credentials
(`mailto://user:pass@host`, `discord://webhook_id/token`, Slack/ntfy tokens).
The app already masks it in logs via `mask_sensitive_url()`, but it was returned
in PLAINTEXT on every `/settings/api` read path -- unlike API keys, which come
back `[REDACTED]`. That ships a secret to the browser / JSON API where it can be
cached by proxies or pasted into bug reports. The fix adds `service_url` to
`DataSanitizer.DEFAULT_SENSITIVE_KEYS`.

These tests pin: the configured URL is redacted on single/bulk/full GET and in
the save-all echo; an unconfigured (empty) URL stays readable (so the
configured/unconfigured distinction survives); and the write-back no-op guard
refuses to overwrite the real value with the redaction sentinel (no round-trip
clobber). A non-secret unit check confirms `is_sensitive_setting` now catches
the key.

Follow-up coverage pins the write/test paths introduced alongside the
redaction: clearing a configured URL stores the empty string (no silent
retention), a sentinel write is a no-op that leaves the stored secret intact,
Test Notification falls back to the stored URL when the field shows the
sentinel, and the settings debug logger redacts the key. Whitespace-only
values count as unconfigured (they stay readable, matching the notification
manager's `.strip()` check).

Ported onto the FastAPI surface (``web/routers/settings.py`` /
``web/fastapi_app.py``) for the ``refactor/fastapi-migration-phase1``
branch. Several assertions below are LEFT FAILING on purpose: a completed
merge audit found this file is the only end-to-end pin for PR #5602's
security contract, and the FastAPI rewrite silently dropped part of it.
Each failing test names the tracking issue in its body/docstring:

  * #5947 / fix in #5956 -- the ``_embeds_redaction_sentinel`` containment
    guard (a value that merely CONTAINS "[REDACTED]" must be rejected)
    does not exist anywhere in ``web/routers/settings.py``.
  * #5960 -- the write-path no-op guard was not narrowed to
    password-typed settings; it still treats "" (not just the exact
    sentinel) as a no-op for EVERY sensitive setting, so clearing
    ``notifications.service_url`` is a silent no-op instead of storing
    the empty string.
  * #5958 -- ``POST /settings/api/notifications/test-url`` lost its
    stored-URL fallback for a sentinel/empty ``service_url`` field.

Do not "fix" these tests by weakening, skipping, or xfailing the
assertion -- that is the exact failure mode this file exists to catch.

    """The HAZARD behind the coercion skip, stated as an executable fact --
    NOT as a stand-in for the call sites.

    Running a merged, secret-bearing container through
    ``coerce_setting_for_write`` under a str-typed ui_element
    ("text"/"textarea"/"password"/"select") flattens it to its Python REPR
    via ``str()``, turning a just-restored secret into a plain,
    non-redacted string persisted under a key nothing downstream treats as
    sensitive -- which ``redact_value`` then ships back verbatim on the
    next GET. That is how #6201 round 1 turned a data-LOSS bug into a
    secret-DISCLOSURE bug.

    WHAT THIS TEST DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO (round-5 review, defect 1):
    an earlier version of it re-implemented the call sites' own
    ``merged if is_reconciled_container else coerce_setting_for_write(...)``
    decision inside the test body and asserted on the result. That reads
    as coverage while pinning nothing: reverting the skip in
    ``_save_all_settings_sync`` or ``_save_settings_sync`` left it green,
    because the test never called a route. A test that reproduces the
    logic it is testing is worse than no test. The call sites are pinned
    end-to-end instead, one route-level test each, in
    ``tests/security/test_settings_egress_and_secrets_fastapi.py``:

      * ``test_save_all_settings_reconciled_container_is_not_coerced_to_str``
      * ``test_save_settings_form_reconciled_container_is_not_coerced_to_str``
      * ``test_nested_secret_edit_under_default_text_ui_element_does_not_leak``
        (``_api_update_setting_sync``)
      * ``test_reconciled_container_on_a_number_row_is_never_logged``
        (both the coercion and the ``validate_setting`` skip, all three
        routes, via the WARNING those converters emit on a numeric row)

    What is left here is the part that genuinely belongs in isolation: the
    merge contract (``_reconciled_container_value_for_write`` restores the
    secret, keeps the edit, and flags the result as reconciled) and proof
    that the coercion those call sites skip really would leak.

    ``_merge_redacted_container``'s dict branch caps itself, so a plain
    over-deep dict has always been rejected cleanly (its sibling test
    above pins that). Its LIST branch is different: before asking
    ``_merge_redacted_container`` to recurse, it consults
    ``_non_sentinel_fields_match`` -- the positional-rebinding gate -- and
    that helper (plus ``_values_equal``, which it bottoms out in) were the
    last two in the merge path with NO depth parameter and no cap, and the
    list branch called the gate with no depth argument at all. Nothing
    stops the gate being reached for a pathological item either:
    ``_container_embeds_sentinel`` answers True unconditionally past its
    own cap, so the gate is consulted for EVERY too-deep list item, and no
    sentinel needs to be present anywhere for that to happen.

    A ~7 KB list whose first item nested past the interpreter's recursion
    limit against a stored list of the same shape therefore raised an
    uncaught ``RecursionError``, which the write routes' broad
    ``except Exception`` turned into an opaque 500 -- falsifying both
    ``_MAX_CONTAINER_DEPTH``'s own comment ("instead of surfacing as an
    opaque 500") and this feature's changelog claim of a clean 400. It is
    also a regression against the pre-#6201 behaviour, where the container
    arm sat BEHIND ``is_sensitive_setting`` and a non-sensitive key like
    ``search.favorites`` never reached these helpers at all; moving the
    container arm in front of that gate exposed the uncapped walk to every
    dict/list write (#6201 round 7).

    ``_non_sentinel_fields_match`` or ``_values_equal``, or stop threading
