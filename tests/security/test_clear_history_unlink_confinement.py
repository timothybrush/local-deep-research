"""``clear_history`` must confine report-file unlinks to the reports root.

``delete_research`` resolves each row's ``report_path`` and refuses to
unlink anything outside ``get_research_outputs_directory()`` — the
documented reason is that the DB column is server-written but a
corrupted row (or a future buggy writer) could point it at
``../../etc/passwd``. Before this fix, ``clear_history`` deleted report
files from the same column with a bare ``Path(report_path).unlink()`` and
no confinement check, so the bulk path could delete arbitrary files the
corrupted-row threat model names.

These tests pin parity with the single-delete path: a report file
outside the reports root survives the bulk clear (rows still deleted),
and a report file inside the root is still unlinked.
