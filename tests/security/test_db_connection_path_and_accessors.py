"""Passwordless accessors and hostile data-dir paths.

Incident context (PR #5596): the never-open / no-side-effect discipline
(round-1 A, round-2 J) extends to every passwordless surface, and the
data-dir path itself is deployer-controlled input. This file pins:

* AC1 ``user_exists`` -- a pure AUTH-database lookup
  (encrypted_db.py::user_exists: it queries ``auth_db``, never the
  user's encrypted DB): unknown user -> False with NO ``ldr_user_*``
  file created and no cache state; a known-on-disk-but-never-opened
  user -> False as well (no DB open
  happens as a side effect). NOTE the one real side effect, pinned as
  actual: the FIRST call bootstraps ``ldr_auth.db`` inside the data dir
  (the auth store itself) -- expected infrastructure, distinct from any
  user-database artifact;
* AG1 a regular FILE where the data dir should be: assignment through
  the ``data_dir`` setter raises FileExistsError cleanly (the setter's
  ``mkdir(exist_ok=True)`` only tolerates an existing DIRECTORY), the
  file is undamaged, and a valid dir assignment still works afterwards;
* AG2 spaces + unicode in the data-dir path: full create/canary/warm/
  cold/close_all cycle works, and the DB artifacts land inside the
  unicode directory verbatim.
