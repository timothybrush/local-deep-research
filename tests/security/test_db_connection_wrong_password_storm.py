"""Warm-cache wrong-password storm racing close_user_database + reopen.

Incident context (PR #5596): the cached-connection bypass existed because a
cache hit returned the engine with no credential check. The fix's moving
parts that THIS file stresses together, at real-SQLCipher level:

* the verifier's fail-closed liveness under a wrong-password storm (every
  attempt must fall through to a key-validating cold open and fail);
* the atomicity of engine+verifier publication (``_cache_connection``) and
  eviction (``close_user_database``) while another thread continuously
  closes and reopens with the CORRECT password;
* that a close storm never turns into an availability hole or a trust hole
  for the legitimate credential.

``test_login_cached_connection_password_extra.py`` pins the single-threaded
shapes (wrong password leaves the legit cache intact; concurrent FIRST open
with wrong/right). ``test_login_cached_connection_password.py`` pins the
warm-cache rejection itself. Neither drives the interleaving where the
cache is being torn down and rebuilt WHILE the attacker hammers it -- the
state in which a non-atomic publication or a verifier/engine mismatch
would be observable.

The invariant sampled throughout (under ``_connections_lock``, so each
snapshot is atomic): the set of usernames in ``connections`` always equals
the set in ``_password_verifiers``. A cached engine must never exist
without its verifier (fail-closed would save it, but it is still a broken
invariant) and a verifier must never outlive its engine (a stale verifier
is exactly what the change_password fix's eviction closes).
