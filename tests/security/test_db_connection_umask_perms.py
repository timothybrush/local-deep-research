"""Artifact permissions under hostile umasks.

Incident context (PR #5596): these files hold the user's entire encrypted
data life -- the .db (ciphertext), the .salt (key material), the WAL
sidecars (plaintext-ordering writes). The connection layer enforces
permissions through TWO different mechanisms with DIFFERENT umask
sensitivity:

* explicit ``chmod`` after the fact (``_ensure_data_dir`` -> 0o700 for
  the directory; ``_best_effort_chmod(db_path, 0o600)`` after structure
  creation) -- chmod is NOT umask-masked, so these hold under any umask;
* explicit modes at creation (``create_database_salt``'s
  ``os.open(..., 0o600)``) -- open(2) modes ARE masked by the process
  umask, so a hostile umask can degrade the salt below 0o600.

This file pins what actually happens at each umask:

* Z1 realistic umasks (0o022 / 0o077 / 0o002): directory 0o700, .db and
  .salt exactly 0o600, WAL/SHM sidecars owner-only, create/open/close all
  clean;
* Z2 extreme umask 0o777 (probed): the salt lands at 0o000, the
  subsequent salt READ inside creation raises PermissionError, and the
  failure-cleanup path removes every artifact -- a clean, loud failure
  with ZERO orphans (see FINDING in the round-6 summary);
* Z3 under the runner's own (fixture-default) umask: every artifact is
  at least owner-only.

The whole module is marked ``serial``: ``os.umask`` is process-global, so
these tests must not share a worker process with anything else.

The whole module is ALSO marked ``nonroot``: every test below starts with
``if os.geteuid() == 0: pytest.skip(...)`` because permission bits are not
enforced for root, so under root every one of them silently no-ops. This
must be carried on the test itself -- it is not safe to rely on a CI step
happening to invoke pytest with ``--user`` or an equivalent unprivileged
runner; that coupling is invisible here and silently regresses to a no-op
the moment a lane runs ``-m serial`` (or this file directly) as root. See
the ``serial`` and ``nonroot`` marker docstrings in pyproject.toml -- a
module carrying both only needs to run once: docker-tests.yml's merged
``serial``/``nonroot`` step selects ``-m 'serial or nonroot'`` under
``--user ldruser``, so this file runs exactly once there regardless of
which marker matched it.

Round-1's cold-open file fingerprinted FAILED opens; round-5 W covered
lifecycle -- neither pinned creation-time permissions vs umask.

# lands at mode 0o000. That is fine in a dedicated serial run and a
# landmine under '-n auto', so the whole module opts out of the parallel
# lane (see the ``serial`` marker in pyproject.toml and the dedicated
# step in .github/workflows/docker-tests.yml).
#
# Also marked ``nonroot``: every test below self-skips under root (see
# the module docstring above). Declaring it explicitly here -- rather
# than leaning on the fact that CI's 'serial' step happens to invoke
# pytest as an unprivileged user -- makes the non-root requirement a
# property of the test, not an accident of CI wiring that a new lane
# running '-m serial' as root would silently violate.
