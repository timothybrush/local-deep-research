"""Log hygiene and auditability of failed credential attempts.

Incident context (PR #5596): the original cached-connection bypass was
invisible -- every attack "succeeded", so it cleared the lockout counter,
matched nothing anomalous in the logs, and left no trace. Two opposite
requirements follow for the fixed failure paths, both pinned here at the
real-SQLCipher level using the repo's canonical ``loguru_caplog_full``
fixture (the package disables its own loguru logging by default; the
fixture re-enables it and captures message + rendered exception block):

* I1 SECRECY -- a NEGATIVE property, deliberately scoped: no presented
  password, no derived hex key and no verifier salt/digest appears in any
  record captured while running (a) warm wrong-password opens, (b) cold
  wrong-password opens, (c) failed metrics sessions and (d) a failed
  change_password. It pins the observable outcome of those four paths and
  nothing more. In particular it is NOT a test of ``redact_secrets``: on
  all four paths the plaintext password never reaches ``str(e)`` in the
  first place (the engine creator closure is handed only the pre-derived
  ``hex_key``), and the traceback half is unobservable here because
  ``loguru_caplog_full`` fixes ``diagnose=False`` to match production. I1
  would therefore still hold with the redaction call deleted -- the
  redaction helpers are covered by ``test_password_leakage.py`` /
  ``test_credential_leak_followup.py``, and the rekey statement's own
  scrubbing by ``test_sqlcipher_rekey_key_not_leaked.py``. Path (d) is
  kept for the credential-bearing frames it drives under capture, NOT as
  coverage of ``change_password``'s handler, which it cannot reach: with
  a wrong old password ``open_user_database`` returns None and
  ``change_password`` returns False before the ``try`` body can raise.
  A positive control asserts that a package-originated record --
  ``_open_user_database_cold``'s own failure warning, which names the
  target username, the same shape I2 below pins -- IS present in the
  capture block, so the "not in captured" assertions cannot pass against
  a capture that recorded nothing at all.
* I2 AUDITABILITY: a failed attempt must not be SILENT either -- the
  cold-open failure path logs ``Failed to open database for user
  {username} ...`` at warning level, so every failed warm-cache
  wrong-password attempt leaves at least one record naming the target
  account. (Anti-invisibility regression guard: the incident's attacks
  produced zero failure records.)

The password-leakage unit tests in test_password_leakage.py /
test_credential_leak_followup.py cover the redaction helpers with mocked
databases; this file exercises the real database paths end to end and also
asserts the derived-key and verifier-material never reach the capture.
