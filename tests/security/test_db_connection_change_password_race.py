"""change_password rekey racing concurrent open_user_database(old_password).

Incident context (PR #5596): the fix's eviction comment in ``change_password``
warns about the exact race these tests drive at the real-database level:

    open_user_database() above cold-opened with old_password and cached that
    engine together with a verifier for old_password. The rekey just
    invalidated that engine's key [...] yet the cached verifier still matches
    old_password -- so until this eviction a concurrent
    open_user_database(old_password) would pass the verifier check and be
    handed the stale-key engine.

``change_password`` now runs under a per-user lock, but that lock excludes
only a second ``change_password``: a concurrent ``open_user_database`` still
runs alongside the rekey, so the window above is still closed by the
eviction alone.

``test_change_password_evicts_stale_engine.py`` pins that the eviction runs
inside the try (via monkeypatched spies on close/rekey/log); it never runs
the race with real threads. ``test_login_cached_connection_password_extra.
py::test_password_change_invalidates_old_verifier_and_arms_new`` pins only
the sequential after-state. Neither proves the end-to-end concurrent
property against a real SQLCipher file:

* WHILE change_password runs, threads calling open_user_database(old) may
  receive engines (legitimately -- the old key is still valid until the
  rekey lands), but every such engine must be DEAD once the rekey
  completes: it must never yield a queryable session afterward.
* AFTER change_password returns: the old key must fail (and cache nothing),
  the new key must open and read data written under previous passwords.
* Under a stress loop of chained rekeys, no snapshot of the manager may
  ever show an engine without its verifier or vice versa (atomic
  publication), and no stale password may ever produce a usable engine.

All tests use the real DatabaseManager with real SQLCipher files under
tmp_path; no mocks on the crypto or cache layer.
