"""Tests that LLM provider error paths never leak API key bytes into logs

Bundled with this file: a production fix to
``src/local_deep_research/llm/providers/implementations/google.py`` whose
``list_models_for_api`` method previously used ``logger.exception(...)``
to log a ``requests`` exception whose message embedded the full request

parameter, so the key value was written to every loguru sink.

class TestSearchEngineParamsKeyLeakage:
    """Pin no-leak behavior for search engines that pass the API key via

    library assembles ``params`` into the request URL before the network
    call; when ``requests`` raises (``ConnectionError``, ``Timeout``,
    etc.), the exception's ``__str__()`` includes that assembled URL —
    and therefore the key.

    Each engine catches the exception in its own try/except and is
    protected today by either ``_sanitize_error_message()``
    (regex-based, defined on the base class) and/or
    ``redact_secrets()`` (literal-value substitution). This contract is
    "safe by convention" — every catch site must remember the wrap. A
    future refactor that consolidates error handling into a base method
    without one of those calls would silently leak. The tests below
    pin the no-leak property so such a regression flips the test.

    Note on Guardian specifically: its key parameter is ``api-key`` (with
    a dash), which the base-class regex at ``search_engine_base.py:984``
    does NOT match (the regex covers ``api_key|apikey|key|token|secret``).
    Guardian therefore relies entirely on ``redact_secrets()`` for the
    URL-leak path — making it the most fragile of the four and the most
    important to pin.
