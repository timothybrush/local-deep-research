"""Session-vs-engine lifetime after close_user_database.

Incident context (PR #5596): the never-open-on-miss invariant of
``get_session`` protects the CACHE. Separately, an Engine object handed
out by ``open_user_database`` / ``get_session`` may OUTLIVE its cache
entry: ``close_user_database`` calls ``engine.dispose()`` (after a WAL
checkpoint), which closes the pool's connections but leaves the engine
usable -- its creator closure retains the pre-derived hex key, so the
next checkout transparently reconnects without retaining the plaintext
password in that closure.

This file covers both halves of that:

* N1 -- OPEN EXPOSURE, asserted as an ``xfail(strict)`` on the correct
  behavior: a ``Session`` handed out before ``close_user_database`` keeps
  reading plaintext AFTER the close, because ``dispose()`` only drops the
  pooled connections while the creator closure retains the same derived
  hex key. ``close_user_database`` is what a logout runs, so a logout does
  not revoke sessions that are already in flight. The test asserts what
  MUST happen -- the held session can no longer read the user's data --
  so it flips to passing when revocation lands.
* N3 the credential plane around that close holds and is asserted
  normally: a later ``open_user_database(correct)`` cold-opens and
  republishes a NEW engine object (the cache was emptied by the close),
  and a later ``open_user_database(wrong)`` fails CLOSED through the
  verifier.
* N4 a resurrected session is NOT a cross-user credential bypass: it is
  bound to ITS user's engine forever and can never reach another user's
  tables.
