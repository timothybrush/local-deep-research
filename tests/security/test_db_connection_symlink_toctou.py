"""Symlink TOCTOU on the .db and .salt paths.

Research context (CAPEC-27 "HTTP Response Splitting"-family redirected-
file attacks; the 2025-26 symlink-race CVE class, e.g. CVE-2026-54370
and the filelock CVE-2025-68146): a local attacker who can plant a
symlink where the application will create or open a file can redirect
the write to a victim path. Planting requires data-dir write access,
which the 0700 owner-only directory already denies to other users --
these tests pin the residual posture for the same-user/compromised-
account case.

Probed and pinned against the real manager:

* AJ1 dangling .db symlink at create -- OPEN EXPOSURE, asserted as an
  ``xfail(strict)`` on the correct behavior. ``Path.exists()`` follows
  symlinks and returns False for a dangling one, so the
  ``db_path.exists()`` guard passes, and ``sqlcipher3.connect`` (via
  ``create_sqlcipher_connection`` with creation_mode=True) follows the
  symlink: the whole database is written AT THE ATTACKER-CHOSEN VICTIM
  PATH outside the data dir, while the salt lands inside and the account
  looks perfectly normal. The test asserts what MUST happen -- an
  ``lstat``/``O_NOFOLLOW`` guard refuses the create and nothing is
  written outside the data dir -- so it flips to passing when the guard
  lands.
* AJ2 .db symlink to an EXISTING victim -- HOLD: the exists() guard
  sees the victim through the link and refuses with "Database already
  exists"; the victim's bytes are untouched.
* AJ3 .salt symlink -- HOLD via O_EXCL no-follow: ``create_database_
  salt`` opens with O_CREAT|O_EXCL, which never follows a symlink (the
  canonical mitigation); the FileExistsError flows into create_user_
  database's orphaned-salt recovery branch, whose unlink removes the
  LINK, and a real salt is created at the expected path. The victim is
  never written.
* AJ4 a symlinked data dir (deployer choice, e.g. /srv symlink) works
  transparently for the full create/open cycle.
