"""Legacy v1 (shared-salt) databases on the post-#5596 connection layer.

Incident context (PR #5596): the fix's verifier is keyed by the password
alone (``_cache_connection`` publishes engine+verifier together on every
credential-proving open) -- it does not care HOW the SQLCipher key was
derived. LDR's v1 format derives keys with the shared
``LEGACY_PBKDF2_SALT`` when no per-database ``.salt`` file exists
(``get_salt_for_database``, sqlcipher_utils.py:42); v2 uses a random
per-DB salt written at creation (``create_database_salt``, line 77). The
open path warns when it sees a v1 database
(encrypted_db.py::_open_user_database_cold).

A genuine v1 database is built here by neutering the single
``create_database_salt`` call inside ``create_user_database`` (monkeypatch
to a no-op): with no ``.salt`` file, every key derivation -- creation,
open, rekey -- takes the legacy-salt-by-omission path. This file pins:

* V1 cold open of a v1 DB: succeeds, caches the engine, ARMS the verifier
  (the fix covers all opens regardless of salt format), and logs the
  legacy-salt warning naming the user; wrong password fails cleanly;
  correct password works warm and cold;
* V2 change_password on a v1 DB (ACTUAL behavior, read from
  ``change_password`` + ``set_sqlcipher_rekey``): the rekey itself also
  derives via ``get_key_from_password(new, db_path)`` -- salt-by-omission
  -- so it SUCCEEDS and the database STAYS v1 (no ``.salt`` file is ever
  created); old key dead, new key opens, data survives;
* V3 a v1 user and a v2 user coexist on one manager: both open, verifiers
  independent, cross-user passwords fail, close_all clears both.
