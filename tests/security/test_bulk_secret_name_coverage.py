"""Regression: the bulk settings GET redacts every password-typed setting we
ship, including ones whose key is flat snake_case.

``GET /settings/api/bulk`` redacts via ``redact_value(key, None, value)`` — it
passes no ``ui_element``, so a password-typed setting is masked only if its key
name matches ``DEFAULT_SENSITIVE_KEYS``. That name check was originally an
exact match on the key's last *dotted* segment, which a flat snake_case key
such as ``local_search_milvus_token`` can never satisfy: with no dots in it,
its "leaf" is the entire key. Such settings shipped in the clear (#5762).

The heart of this module is ``test_every_shipped_password_setting_is_redacted``:
rather than hardcoding leaf names (the shape this file had after #5028, which
is why #5762 slipped through), it ENUMERATES the shipped
``defaults/**/*.json`` and asserts the suffix-only predicate covers every
setting declared ``ui_element: "password"``. Add a new secret setting whose key
the predicate does not recognize and this test fails before the leak ships.

IMPORTANT CAVEAT verified against the merge commit that added the broadened
underscore-suffix arm (#5771, 0a75d2df5): every one of the 34 settings this
test currently enumerates is a *dotted* key with an exact ``api_key`` or
``password`` leaf (e.g. ``llm.openai.api_key``), which arm 1 (exact match)
already redacted before #5771. No shipped setting has the flat snake_case
shape (``local_search_milvus_token``-style, no dots) that the broadened arm
exists to catch — that key is used only in this file's own docstrings and
synthetic test cases below. So this test currently passes identically with
the broadened arm reverted; it guards against a *regression* in the exact-
match arm and against a future password setting shaped so the qualifier
carve-out wrongly exempts it (see the comment above
``_NON_SECRET_LEAF_PREFIXES`` in ``data_sanitizer.py``), but it does not
exercise, and cannot fail on, the flat-key broadening itself. That coverage
lives in ``test_bulk_get_redacts_secret_key_shapes`` and
``test_bulk_get_redacts_named_secret`` below, which use synthetic
flat-key names precisely because no shipped setting takes that shape yet —
today, the broadened arm protects only USER-CREATED settings (e.g. a
self-hosted search engine's user-added ``*_token``/``*_api_key`` config),
not anything this project ships.

Its mirror, ``test_no_shipped_non_secret_setting_is_redacted``, pins the other
direction: widening the predicate must not start masking ordinary settings.
``search.engine.web.*.requires_api_key`` is a checkbox whose leaf ends in
``_api_key``; masking it would ship "[REDACTED]" to the settings UI in place of
true/false and make the write-back no-op guards refuse legitimate writes.
