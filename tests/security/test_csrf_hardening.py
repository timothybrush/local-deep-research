# allow: no-sut-import — asserts the CSRF exemption policy of the live middleware
"""Test that CSRF exemptions stay narrowly scoped.

Ported from the Flask-WTF era (which inspected
``app.extensions['csrf']._exempt_blueprints``). Under FastAPI the
``CSRFMiddleware`` exempts by PATH, not by Blueprint object — and the policy
is deliberately stricter: only the WebSocket mount and the two
auth-bootstrap endpoints are exempt. Notably ``/api/v1`` is NOT exempt
anymore (it authenticates with session cookies, so CSRF applies), which is
a hardening over the old Flask behaviour where the api_v1 blueprint was
blanket-exempt.
