"""PRAGMA- and SQL-hostile passwords through the real key path.

Incident context (PR #5596): the connection layer never interpolates a
password into SQL. ``get_key_from_password``
(sqlcipher_utils.py::get_key_from_password) derives raw bytes with
PBKDF2 and the key reaches SQLCipher as a hex literal
(``PRAGMA key = "x'...'"`` / ``PRAGMA rekey``), so a password
that LOOKS like SQL or a PRAGMA is just key material. This file pins that
end-to-end for a battery of hostile strings, each as a REAL database:

* create with the hostile password -> canary write;
* warm open with the SAME hostile password reuses the cached engine
  (verifier matches -- the HMAC covers the exact bytes);
* a wrong-password sibling fails closed, warm and cold;
* close + cold reopen with the hostile password works and reads the
  canary.

Complements test_password_verifier_primitive.py (digest-level
distinctness for unusual strings): this is the full create/open/verify
cycle against real SQLCipher files. The KDF-1000 knob keeps the battery
fast.
