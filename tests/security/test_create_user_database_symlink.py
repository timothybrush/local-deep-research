"""``create_user_database`` must never follow a symlink at the DB path.

``Path.exists()`` follows links and is False for a dangling one, so a link
planted at ``data_dir/ldr_user_<hash>.db`` pointing outside the data dir
passed the guard and the database was written at the link target (#6354).
The path is now refused when it is a link, and the file is materialized
with ``O_CREAT | O_EXCL`` (plus ``O_NOFOLLOW``) so a link planted after the
guard cannot redirect the create either.
