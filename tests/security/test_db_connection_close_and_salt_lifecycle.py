"""Close idempotency and salt stability across the rekey lifecycle.

Incident context (PR #5596): eviction correctness is what keeps the
cache trustworthy -- ``close_user_database`` pops engine AND verifier
together under the lock, and ``change_password``'s rekey must not
disturb the on-disk key-derivation inputs. This file pins the two
remaining lifecycle edges:

* AE1 double-close is a no-op (the ``if username in connections`` guard
    makes the second close silently skip) -- single-threaded and for a
  user never opened; no raise, maps stay clean;
* AE2 concurrent double-close: 2 threads x 6 iterations racing closes
  of the same warm user -- no unhandled exception, the pairing invariant
  holds under ``_connections_lock`` at every sample, maps empty after,
  reopen works (round-4 O's pairing discipline applied to the close
  path);
* AF1 salt stability across rekey: the .salt bytes (sha256), its 0o600
  mode, and the absence of .salt.new/.salt.tmp leftovers are identical
  before and after change_password -- the rekey changes the FILE key,
  never the salt (set_sqlcipher_rekey reads the same salt);
* AF2 sidecars after rekey + final close: none left (the close-time WAL
  checkpoint removes them, mirroring round-4 S on the rekey path).
