"""Many-user cache hygiene under sequential and concurrent churn.

Incident context (PR #5596): the cache maps (``connections``,
``_password_verifiers``, ``_init_locks``) are the entire trust state of
the connection layer. At scale -- many accounts churning through one
process -- two operational security properties must hold:

* W1 after 30 sequential create/write/close cycles and a final
  ``close_all_databases``, every map is empty (close_all clears all
  three, encrypted_db.py::close_all_databases) and the liveness
  accessors read zero;
* W2 the same 30 users created and churned CONCURRENTLY across 4 threads
  (each owning a subset, barrier-start, EVERY user with its own distinct
  password), with the engine/verifier pairing invariant sampled under
  ``_connections_lock`` throughout, no failed opens, and every user
  reopening afterwards reading its OWN canary.

FD-count deltas are deliberately NOT asserted here: pyproject.toml's
``fd_canary`` marker documents that ``/proc/self/fd`` assertions are
noisy under parallel execution, and this file belongs in the parallel
lane for the cache-hygiene coverage above. ``tests/utilities/
test_close_base_llm.py`` owns the FD-leak canaries.

Per-user schema migration is neutered for these tests ONLY (monkeypatch
of ``initialize.initialize_database`` to a no-op) -- the exact isolation
pattern of ``tests/database/test_concurrent_user_db_open.py`` -- because
30 full migrations would blow the run-time budget while exercising
nothing this file asserts on (the cache, the open/close lifecycle, and
descriptors are all fully real, backed by real SQLCipher files).

    ``--cov-fail-under``) instead of failing on the named "deadlocked"
