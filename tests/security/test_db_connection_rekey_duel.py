"""Racing double-rekey: two concurrent change_password calls, one DB.

Incident context (PR #5596): ``change_password`` originally held NO lock
across the rekey, because it is built from the public pieces -- close,
open(old), PRAGMA rekey, evict. Two threads calling
``change_password(user, old, new_A)`` and ``change_password(user, old,
new_B)`` at a barrier therefore interleaved freely, and CI showed both
reporting success. A per-user lock now serialises the two calls; which
one wins is still scheduler-dependent. What must NOT be
scheduler-dependent is the existential shape afterwards:

* the file ends up keyed by exactly ONE of {old, new_A, new_B} -- a file
  corrupted by interleaved rekeys would leave NO password working;
* the winning password opens, and its engine reads the canary written
  before the race (data survival);
* the losing passwords fail cleanly (None), never a broken engine;
* after a final close_all_databases the manager holds nothing, and the
  engine/verifier pairing invariant holds at every sampled instant.

Round 1's test_db_connection_change_password_race.py pinned the
old-vs-rekey race (hammer threads READ while one rekey chain runs). This
file is the two-WRITERS duel: both threads rekey. It is parametrised over
a single run id: the identifier is kept so the credentials stay unique
per run and a maintainer chasing a flake can widen the range locally, but
repeating a byte-identical duel in CI buys no schedule diversity.
