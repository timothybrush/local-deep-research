"""``change_password`` edge cases: same-password, empty-new, wrong-old.

Incident context (PR #5596): change_password is a credential-taking
write path built from public pieces (close -> open(old) -> PRAGMA rekey
-> evict). Its guards decide whether a bad request can hurt the file.
Round-4 P pinned the rekey's effect on held credentials; this file pins
the INPUT-validation edges:

* AB1 rekey to the SAME password: succeeds (True), the single password
  keeps working cold, data survives, exactly one cache entry after
  reopen (no double caching);
* AB2 empty NEW password -- DATA-DESTRUCTION BUG, asserted as an
  ``xfail(strict)`` on the correct behavior. ``change_password``
  performs NO ``_is_valid_encryption_key`` check on ``new_password``
  (the guard exists on create/open only -- ``create_user_database``
  and ``open_user_database`` both call it).
  The rekey derives a key from the empty string and SUCCEEDS, so the
  call returns True -- and the database is then permanently UNOPENABLE:
  the old password no longer matches the rekeyed file, and opening with
  "" is refused by ``_is_valid_encryption_key`` on the open path. The
  test asserts what MUST happen (refuse with False, leave the database
  openable with the old password), so it flips to passing the moment the
  guard lands.
* AB3 wrong OLD password: clean False (the open(old) inside fails), no
  rekey (old password still opens, the would-be new one still fails),
  canary intact, salt bytes unchanged, nothing cached afterwards.
