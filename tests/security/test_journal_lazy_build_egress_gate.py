"""The journal-data fetch must honour the user's egress scope everywhere.

Three entry points can pull the journal-quality datasets (OpenAlex / DOAJ
/ GitHub, hundreds of MB):

* the dashboard download button (``metrics.py``), which refuses with 403
  under PRIVATE_ONLY / STRICT;
* the reputation filter's background fetch thread, skipped under those
  scopes (``_should_skip_journal_fetch_for_scope``, pinned by
  ``test_egress_pep_coverage.py``); and
* the lazy build — ``JournalQualityDB._build_or_raise`` runs implicitly
  on any read through ``_ensure_engine`` when the DB file is missing or
  fails validation, and used to decide on test mock mode alone.

The lazy build is reached from two directions, and each needs its own
gate because each sees a different signal:

* inside a research run, on a worker thread that arms the run's egress
  context: ``_build_or_raise`` reads that context and turns the network
  download off (a local build from already-present snapshots still
  proceeds — only the network is off the table); and
* from the dashboard read routes, which Starlette runs on anyio
  threadpool workers where NO context is armed, leaving the context gate
  structurally blind. Those routes resolve the scope a research
  run for the user would get — the stored ``policy.egress_scope`` with
  ADAPTIVE resolved against the user's primary engine, as the worker and
  the reputation filter resolve it — and answer "unavailable" rather than let a page load DOWNLOAD the
  datasets.

The route gate answers the same question the build does, in the same
order, because the compiled DB is not the predicate that governs a
download — the snapshot is:

1. ``openalex_sources.json.gz`` on disk → the build compiles from disk
   and never asks the network. Allowed under every scope, including a
   forbidding one, which is the whole point: an offline rebuild must not
   darken the dashboard.
2. No snapshot, but the compiled DB exists AND passes the same validity
   probe ``_ensure_engine`` applies → no build runs. Allowed.
3. Neither → a read would have to download. Only here does the
   effective scope decide, and only here is the answer "unavailable".

Case 2 is not decoration: ``_ensure_engine`` rebuilds on a FAILED
validation as well as on a missing file, and three
``JOURNAL_QUALITY_SCHEMA_VERSION`` bumps have shipped, so every install
that upgrades past one takes that branch on its next read.

These tests pin both gates plus the two branches reachable only through
the first one: the ``policy_audit`` record and the scope-specific error.
