"""WAL-deletion rollback attack against a warm per-user database.

Research context (sqlite.org/howtocorrupt.html, §"Things that can go
wrong": deleting the -wal file silently rolls the database back to the
state at the last checkpoint -- transactions committed after the
checkpoint are simply lost. For an app whose database rows carry
security state, rollback = silent revivification of revoked state.

Probed and pinned here against the real manager (HOLD on all three
fronts):

* AH1 mid-open WAL deletion SURVIVES: POSIX unlink semantics mean the
  engine's still-open fd keeps the WAL inode alive; the close-time
  ``PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)`` (encrypted_db.py::_checkpoint_wal)
  flushes those frames into the main .db through that fd BEFORE
  the final connection close deletes the (name-less) WAL. The post-
  checkpoint canary written into the deleted WAL is readable after
  reopen -- no rollback, no corruption.
* AH2 post-close there IS no rollback window: ``close_user_database``
  checkpoints and SQLite removes the -wal on the last close (round-4 S1
  property), so deleting "the -wal" after close is a no-op against a
  nonexistent file and the canary is durable.
* AH3 a FOREIGN -wal (captured live from a different user's database
  and planted before open) is refused at the credential plane -- the
  open returns None, nothing is cached, and none of the other user's
  data is ever served. That half is asserted normally.
* AH4 the availability half is an OPEN EXPOSURE, asserted as an
  ``xfail(strict)`` on the correct behavior: SQLite's WAL recovery
  WRITES into the target's main .db during that failed open, so removing
  the planted artifacts is not enough -- the account stays permanently
  unopenable and only a restore of the main .db recovers it. A planted
  sidecar must be a recoverable nuisance, not account destruction.
