"""Release-gate integration test for the journal-quality data pipeline.

Why this test exists
====================

The journal-quality system depends on five external data sources:

- OpenAlex Sources (S3 bulk dump)     ~280K journals/conferences
- DOAJ public CSV dump                 ~22K  open-access journals
- Stop Predatory Journals              ~2.5K predatory entries
- JabRef abbreviation list             ~66K abbreviations
- OpenAlex Institutions (S3 bulk dump) ~120K institutions

If any of these upstreams change their schema (rename a field, drop a
column, restructure the JSON layout), the bundled-data tier silently
breaks: every academic search result starts coming back unscored. This
test catches that BEFORE we cut a release.

Structure
---------

A session-scoped fixture downloads ALL FIVE sources **in parallel** via
``ThreadPoolExecutor``. Each per-source test then asserts file presence
and record-shape against the already-downloaded data (fast). A separate
test runs ``build_db()`` against the freshly-downloaded files and a
final test verifies the runtime accessor can score a real journal.

Parallelism is essential: the OpenAlex Institutions API alone takes
~10 minutes (550 paginated requests). Sequentially, all five would
exceed 25 minutes; in parallel the wall-clock is bounded by the
slowest single source (~10 min for institutions).

This test is intentionally **not** part of the regular suite — it pulls
~30 MB from third-party APIs and runs ~10–15 minutes wall-clock. It's
marked with ``@pytest.mark.integration`` and ``@pytest.mark.slow`` so
it's skipped by default; the dedicated workflow opts in via ``-m``
selection.

Run locally with::

    pytest tests/integration/test_journal_quality_release_gate.py \\
        -m "integration and slow" --no-header -v --timeout=2700

Or via the dedicated CI workflow::
