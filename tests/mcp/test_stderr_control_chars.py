"""The MCP stderr sink emits package logs, with control characters stripped.

A research query reaches the MCP log verbatim (query[:80] in the
citation-handler warnings), so a query containing a newline used to split one
WARNING into two stderr lines. The web path has stripped control characters
since config_logger grew its patcher; the MCP subprocess builds its own sink
and did not.

``local_deep_research/__init__.py`` disables the package's own loguru
namespace, and only ``config_logger`` re-enabled it, so the MCP sink also has
to enable it or it sees nothing the package logs.
