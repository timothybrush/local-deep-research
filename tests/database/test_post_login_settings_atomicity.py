"""
Regression tests for the post-login settings atomicity invariant.

Three load-bearing properties are locked in here:

1. On failure mid-write, the DB rolls back cleanly — no partial rows,
   no orphaned `app.version`. The next login retries from a clean
   state instead of entering the sticky loop
   (commit 621d8d0d — fix(auth): atomic settings reload + app.version
   update on login).

2. On success, both the defaults import AND `app.version` persist
   together — the invariant that makes
   `db_version_matches_package()` useful.

3. `engine.dispose()` on a busy engine does NOT break a thread holding
   a checked-out connection. This is the SA 2.0 contract
   (`QueuePool.dispose` drains only idle queue entries,
   `Engine.dispose` calls `pool.recreate()`, checked-out connections
   keep working) and we lock it in so a future SA upgrade cannot
   silently change it. This test makes PR #3487's "dispose orphans
   checked-out" mechanism claim falsifiable — if it ever starts being
   true for our SQLCipher+WAL path, this test fails.
