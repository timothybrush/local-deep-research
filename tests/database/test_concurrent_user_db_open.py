"""Concurrency tests for ``DatabaseManager.open_user_database`` cold-open.

Regression test for the race where two simultaneous first-opens of the same
user's database both ran Alembic migrations against one database file at once,
with the loser failing (Alembic's non-thread-safe module-level proxy / the
``alembic_version`` row update). The per-user init lock must serialize the
cold-open so the engine build + migration runs exactly once.
