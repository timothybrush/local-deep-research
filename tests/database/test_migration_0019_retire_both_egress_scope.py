"""Tests for migration 0019: retire the 'both' egress scope.

Pins the upgrade semantics:
- ``policy.egress_scope`` rows holding ``both`` are rewritten to ``adaptive``;
  every other (concrete) scope is preserved untouched.
- The settings ``value`` column stores JSON text (``"both"`` with quotes); the
  rewritten value must be stored as ``"adaptive"`` (single JSON encoding) — a
  raw-bytes assertion guards against double-encoding (see migration 0018).
- Idempotency: re-running the upgrade is a no-op.
- A DB with no matching row upgrades cleanly (rowcount 0, no error).
