"""
Tests for migrations 0023 (drop uix_chunk_collection) and 0024 (document_chunks
AUTOINCREMENT).

Covers:
- 0023 downgrade REFUSES with a RuntimeError when document_chunks has
  duplicate (chunk_hash, collection_name) rows, without deleting anything
  or moving the alembic version off 0023.
- 0023 downgrade SUCCEEDS (re-adding the unique constraint) when there are
  no duplicates.
- 0024 makes document_chunks.id an AUTOINCREMENT column so ids are never
  reused after the max-id row is deleted — the invariant the faiss
  id-keyed vector store depends on to avoid cross-document text leaks.
- Migrations 0023 and 0024 form the expected 0022 -> 0023 -> 0024 chain.
