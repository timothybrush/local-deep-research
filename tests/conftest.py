    ``TestClient`` response does not have. We add them to the response class

    Two things about this function are load-bearing, and both were bugs:

    * **Which class gets patched.** This used to ``import httpx`` directly
      and decorate ``httpx.Response``. When httpx2 is installed,
      ``starlette.testclient`` binds *that* module instead, so the patch

      is the worst possible shape for a CI signal. Resolving the class from
      ``starlette.testclient`` means the patch cannot disagree with the
      client about which httpx is in play.

    * **When it runs.** This used to be inline in
      ``_make_flask_compat_client``, i.e. installed by a function-scoped
      fixture. A class attribute is process-global state, so that made every
      test reading ``.data`` depend on some *earlier* test in the same xdist
      worker having built a compat client first — an ordering dependency
      that holds or breaks according to how xdist happens to shard the
      suite. Calling it at conftest import time gives every worker the

    """Like ``loguru_caplog`` but captures the exception block too.

    Use this in security tests that assert a credential never appears in
    log output. The default ``loguru_caplog`` fixture uses
    ``format="{message}"``, which excludes the rendered exception block
    that ``logger.exception()`` (and ``exc_info=True``) emit — so a leak
    that lives only in the traceback would false-pass.

    This fixture appends ``{exception}`` to the format and enables
    ``backtrace=True`` so the cause chain (``__cause__`` / ``__context__``)
    is rendered. ``diagnose`` stays off to match production
    (``utilities/log_utils.py`` runs ``diagnose=False`` unless
    ``LDR_APP_DEBUG`` is set).
