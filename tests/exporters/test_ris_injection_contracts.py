"""RIS field-injection contracts for the reference export.

Report source titles and URLs derive from fetched web content. An RIS
file is line-structured — any newline smuggled into a field value could
inject further ``TY``/``ER`` records that a reference manager (Zotero,
EndNote) could import as real entries. Source extraction alone does not
exclude bare carriage returns or Unicode line separators. The exporter
flattens control characters at the RIS serialization boundary; these tests
pin both extraction and that final single-line field guarantee.
