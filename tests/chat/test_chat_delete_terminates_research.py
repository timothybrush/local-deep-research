"""Integration regression test: deleting a session terminates its research.

Previously, `ChatService.delete_session` issued a hard ``db.delete``
on the chat_sessions row. Any in-progress research linked to that session
had its ``chat_session_id`` set to NULL by the FK (ON DELETE SET NULL),
but the worker thread itself was left running — burning LLM cycles on a
conversation the user had already discarded.

The fix collapses the termination-flag set and the DELETE into one
transaction (chat/service.py:delete_session) so the worker is signalled
to terminate before the session row is removed.

This test exercises the full integration path:

1. Insert a chat session via ChatService.
2. Manually insert a ResearchHistory row tied to that session with
   status="in_progress" (simulating a research that was just spawned).
3. Call ChatService.delete_session(...).
4. Assert that ``set_termination_flag`` was called with the in-flight
   research id BEFORE the row was removed.

The test deliberately patches ``set_termination_flag`` so we can assert
on call args without needing a real worker thread.
