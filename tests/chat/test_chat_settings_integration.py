"""Integration tests for chat-mode settings extraction.

Replaces three earlier tests that only asserted on locally-constructed
dict literals (no production-code import) with checks that actually
exercise the chat route's settings helper and reproduce the snapshot
field-extraction the research pipeline performs.

These do NOT spin up a full DB — ``_load_settings`` is patched to
return a controlled snapshot and the extraction is asserted against
the same field names the production research path reads.
