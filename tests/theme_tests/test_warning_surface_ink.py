# allow: no-sut-import — guardian; statically parses the shipped CSS files
# for a warning-ink regression rather than exercising Python production code
"""A filled warning surface must use the warning ink token, not a literal.

test_light_theme_contrast.py checks the *values* themes assign to
--warning-color and --text-on-warning, but the component CSS (news.css,
styles.css, ...) only ever writes the tokens, e.g.
``background: var(--warning-color); color: var(--text-on-warning);``. A
regression there -- reverting to a literal ``color: #000`` or ``color:
white`` -- can't be caught by computing contrast from theme files, because
the literal never appears in any theme; it appears in the component
stylesheet itself. This statically greps every component stylesheet under
``web/static/css`` for rules whose background is exactly
``var(--warning-color)`` and asserts the same rule pairs it with the warning
ink token. Warning surfaces styled from template ``<style>`` blocks or JS
inline styles are outside this sweep.

Selectors this repo already knows don't need (or can't yet have) that
pairing are excluded explicitly below, with a reason, instead of silently
skipping or asserting something unverified about them.
