/**
 * Regression guard: Notes is reachable from the mobile nav.
 *
 * Pre-commit bb74fc5f4, the desktop sidebar was hidden at <768px and
 * mobile-navigation.js had no Notes entry in the More sheet. Users on
 * phones had no UI path to /notes at all. The Notes entry now lives at
 * mobile-navigation.js:154 (data-item-id="notes"). This spec locks
 * that entry in so a future deletion can't ship silently.
 *
 * Placed OUTSIDE tests/notes/ so it isn't caught by the
 * Desktop-only `notes-paths` project. It naturally runs on every
 * device project; we scope to a single iPhone-SE run to avoid
 * multiplying runtime 15x for a regression-only test.
