"""Integration tests against the ACTUAL progress_callback closure inside
run_research_process — not a replicated helper.

Why this file exists
--------------------
The unit tests in ``test_research_service_execution.py`` exercise the
detailed-mode progress logic via a local ``_apply_detailed_progress``
helper that mirrors production. That pattern is enough for arithmetic
edge cases, but it cannot catch bugs in the integration boundary
between the closure, ``SearchSystem.set_progress_callback``, and
``globals.update_progress_and_check_active``.

PR #3806's original review missed exactly such an integration bug
(F1): the closure pinned the bar to 100 whenever ``phase="complete"``
arrived — including the mid-report emissions that every strategy
produces from inside ``analyze_topic``. The replica-helper tests
passed; an integration test would have caught it.

Pattern
-------
1. Mock ``AdvancedSearchSystem`` with a ``side_effect`` on
   ``set_progress_callback`` that captures the inner closure.
2. Make ``analyze_topic`` raise ``ResearchTerminatedException`` so
   ``run_research_process`` exits gracefully — but the callback has
   been captured.
3. Mock ``update_progress_and_check_active`` with a stateful
   ``side_effect`` that mimics ``globals.py``'s monotonic guard.
4. Yield the captured callback while patches are still active so
   tests can call it with bug-triggering sequences.
