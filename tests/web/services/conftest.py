"""Shared fixtures for socket-service tests.

The chat feature added a research-ownership guard to
``SocketIOService.__handle_subscribe`` so that an authenticated user
cannot subscribe to another user's research_id. The check pulls
``username`` from ``flask.session`` and consults the user's encrypted
DB via the new ``_user_owns_research`` helper.

Pre-existing socket-service tests in this directory exercise the
subscription bookkeeping (set membership, snapshot emit, etc.) and do
NOT set up a Flask request context or a real DB. To keep their intent
intact, this autouse fixture mocks the new authorization layer so every
test in this directory exercises the subscribe-as-owner code path
unless it opts out by overriding the fixtures.

Tests that explicitly want to exercise the negative path
(``_user_owns_research → False`` or ``session.get("username") → None``)
should override the relevant mock with their own ``patch.object`` call
inside the test body.
