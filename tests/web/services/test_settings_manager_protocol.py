"""
Protocol-based interface tests for SettingsManager.

Ported from ``tests/web/services/test_settings_manager_protocol.py`` (deleted
in the Flask->FastAPI migration). The only translation is the consumer
module: main's ``research_library/routes/rag_routes.py`` became
``web/routers/rag.py`` on this branch. The contract being pinned -- that the
SettingsManager the RAG routes import is the unified
``settings.manager.SettingsManager``, which alone has ``get_bool_setting``
and ``get_settings_snapshot`` -- is unchanged.

These tests define and verify the contract that SettingsManager must fulfill
for consumers like web/routers/rag.py. Using Python's Protocol (PEP 544) enables:
- Static type checking with mypy to catch wrong imports at development time
- Runtime verification with @runtime_checkable
- Clear documentation of required interface

This prevents regressions like issue #1877 where the wrong SettingsManager
was imported, causing 'object has no attribute' errors at runtime.
