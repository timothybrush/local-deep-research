"""Unit test for the WebSocket subscribe research-ownership guard.

The `__handle_subscribe` handler must reject subscription attempts when
the authenticated user does not own the research being subscribed to.
Without this guard, any logged-in user could subscribe to a guessed or
leaked research UUID and receive its progress events — a cross-user
information disclosure.

We exercise the `_user_owns_research` static helper directly so we do
not need to stand up a Flask app or the singleton wrapper.
