"""Guard against the global-name-shadowing class of bug.

base.html loads the shared service scripts (services/api.js, services/ui.js,
services/formatting.js, ...) with ``defer``, and the notes page templates load
their page scripts (pages/note-detail.js, pages/notes.js) with ``defer`` too
(after their dependencies, for load-order correctness). Among deferred scripts
load order is document order, so if two DISTINCT scripts each declare the same
top-level ``function NAME`` / ``const NAME`` / ``let NAME`` / ``var NAME``, the
later one OVERWRITES the earlier — one version silently never runs.

This is exactly what broke "Start Research does nothing": api.js's
``startResearch(query, mode)`` clobbered note-detail.js's ``startResearch()``
(the modal posted a serialized DOM element as the query), and ui.js's
``showError(container, message)`` clobbered the pages' ``showError(message)``
so every error toast no-opped.

The collision was removed by renaming the page-local functions. This test
locks the invariant so it cannot silently regress: no top-level name in a
notes page script may collide with a top-level name in a script base.html
loads. If you add a page-level helper, give it a name unique from the shared
service scripts (or wrap the page script in an IIFE/module).
