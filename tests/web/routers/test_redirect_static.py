"""``/redirect-static/<path>`` must preserve the path it was given.

This route exists so bookmarked or externally-linked legacy static URLs keep
working. The initial FastAPI port broke it in two independent ways while
leaving it *enumerable* — so every route-parity and route-count check passed
while the behaviour was gone:

* the path converter. Flask's ``<path:path>`` matches slashes; Starlette's
  plain ``{path}`` does not. Every realistic legacy URL contains at least one
  (``css/styles.css``), so they all 404'd.
* the handler ignored the captured parameter entirely and redirected to a
  bare ``/static``, dropping the filename even for single-segment paths.

Flask's version was ``redirect(url_for("static", filename=path))``.
