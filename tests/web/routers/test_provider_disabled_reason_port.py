"""Unit tests for the reason string attached to blocked provider options.

``require_local_llm`` has three possible origins and the dropdown has to name
the right one. Naming the checkbox unconditionally (the first cut of #5662)
sent users who had set the ``private_only`` egress scope hunting for a
checkbox that was already unticked, and gave users under an operator env lock
no hint that the control was not theirs to change.

Port of ``tests/web/routes/test_provider_disabled_reason.py`` (#5749).
``_provider_disabled_reason`` and its ``_model_discovery_provider_decision``
callers were added to the deleted Flask ``web/routes/settings_routes.py``;
this ports them onto the FastAPI ``web/routers/settings.py`` module the
migration left them out of.
