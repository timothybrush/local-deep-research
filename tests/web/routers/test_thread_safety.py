"""
Regression tests for FastAPI threadpool / thread-local-session interaction.

The settings/library/rag routers must NOT pre-create SettingsManager via
FastAPI Depends, because anyio's threadpool can run a sync dep on one
worker and the route handler on a different worker. SettingsManager has
a strict _check_thread_safety() that raises RuntimeError when used in a
thread other than the one it was created in.

Pattern that triggered the bug (now reverted):

    def my_route(
        username=Depends(require_auth),
        settings_manager=Depends(get_settings_manager_dep),
    ):
        return settings_manager.get_all_settings()  # ~25% chance of 500

These tests fire concurrent requests at endpoints that exercise
SettingsManager and assert all of them succeed. Run with -n 1 to keep
the test process simple — concurrency is inside the test, not pytest-xdist.

    Regression test for the BLOCKER where ``DatabaseMiddleware.__call__``
    invoked the synchronous ``ensure_user_database()`` directly from an
    async ASGI ``__call__``. ``ensure_user_database()`` opens a SQLCipher
    connection (PBKDF2 key derivation, file I/O); on the event loop this
    serializes every authenticated request behind it.

    The fix wraps the call in ``asyncio.to_thread``. To prove it works we
    fire concurrent requests at a cheap authenticated endpoint and check
    wall-clock is closer to the parallel lower bound than the serialised
    upper bound. We can't measure the SQLCipher open time directly (it's
    typically only on first request after login), but if the event loop
    were blocked, ``-n 4`` of pytest-xdist would also make this test
    flaky — the existing ``test_concurrent_settings_api`` already proves
    the event loop is shared correctly today.
