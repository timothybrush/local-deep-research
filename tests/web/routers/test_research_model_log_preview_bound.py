"""Regression tests for #6305: request-body values in the research router's
log lines must go through the bounded preview helper from #6191, not an
eager f-string.

``_extract_research_params`` and ``_start_research_sync``
(``web/routers/research.py``) interpolated the body-supplied ``model``
into eager f-strings at three points of one request (``Using model from
request``, ``Extracted model value`` and the ``Starting research with
provider ...`` info line), and the other raw body values logged on that
path (``model_provider``, ``search_engine``, ``iterations``,
``questions_per_iteration``, ``strategy``, the news-search
``triggered_by``, the body's key list on the ``Request data keys`` line)
had the same shape. So did ``save_research_strategy``
(``web/services/research_service.py``), which ``_start_research_sync``
calls synchronously with the same raw ``strategy`` and which f-stringed
it at DEBUG and INFO. An f-string is evaluated before loguru sees it, so
the FULL ``str()`` of the value was built on every request regardless of
log level, and the info lines are emitted at the default level into
every sink. For a wide dict/list posted as ``{"model": {...}}`` that is
full serialisation work per request, the same shape #6191 bounded for
the notes router's log-value previews.

Same policy as ``tests/notes/test_log_value_preview_dict_bound.py``:
``isinstance(preview, str)`` / ``len(preview) <= 100`` style assertions
are NOT regression guards (``reprlib`` bounds the output even when it
does the full work), so the tests below are written to fail under these
weakenings instead:

  (W1) un-wiring the fix at any call site: back to an eager f-string in
       ``_extract_research_params``, ``_start_research_sync`` or
       ``save_research_strategy``, or any other eager stringification
       of a body value added next to the bounded call (e.g.
       ``_audit = repr(search_engine)``)
  (W2) re-pointing the imported name at a naive helper (e.g.
       ``repr(value)[:100]``), which touches every element again
  (W3) settings router only: reintroducing the eager
       ``f"Converting checkbox ... {value}"`` message that #6201
       replaced with the value-free key/type/length line

No HTTP client / DB needed: the source guards run against the imported
modules directly, and the call-path probes mock the per-user session and
the settings manager at their import seams (the idiom of
``test_start_research_ssrf.py``), so everything stays fast and
deterministic. Every call-path probe feeds a wide value to EVERY body
field the function logs, so (W1) at any one of those sites, not just the
named ones, fails the probe and not only a source guard.
