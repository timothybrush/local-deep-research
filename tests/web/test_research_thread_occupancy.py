"""Guard for ADR-0013 decision 1: one daemon thread per research run.

ADR-0013 (``docs/decisions/0013-research-runs-keep-daemon-thread.md``)
decides that each research run started through ``start_research_process``
(the web UI and the queue) keeps its own dedicated daemon thread, with the
server-wide research semaphore enforced before that thread is spawned.
This file pins that shape of the spawn path so a regression (a second
thread per run, a non-daemon thread, a double spawn, a leaked permit) fails
loudly.

This is NOT #5854's measure of done. ADR-0013 redefines that as "no AnyIO
worker-pool thread blocks on model I/O, and fan-out inside a single run
costs no extra OS thread"; research daemon threads were never the AnyIO
pool threads #5854 measured. That measurement needs a different instrument
and is tracked in #6467.

What this file pins
-------------------
The spawn path, exactly:

1. ``start_research_process`` (``web/services/research_service.py``)
   creates exactly one ``_ctx_wrapped`` daemon thread per run, and
2. at the sampled instant while N callbacks are parked, no additional
   ``_ctx_wrapped`` thread is live in the process.

Both are measured by thread identity, not by a process-global count.
``threading.enumerate()`` is filtered to threads whose ``_target``
qualname is ``start_research_process.<locals>._ctx_wrapped`` (or whose
CPython-assigned name carries that same target), and the set that
appeared during the run must equal the set of thread objects the spawn
calls returned. The assertion is exact: ``== runs``.
``threading.active_count()`` is recorded as a diagnostic only — it is
process-global and would pick up unrelated threads.

What this file does NOT pin
---------------------------
The research runner itself. ``run_research_callback`` is substituted with
a stub that parks, so ``run_research_process`` — the LLM calls, the
search engines, the encrypted-database work — never executes. It cannot:
it requires a username, a user password and a real per-user DB, and
``research_service.py`` contains no executor / ``to_thread`` / AnyIO seam
that could dispatch it without them.

Consequently this guard does not observe async work inside the run.
It will not fail merely because parts of the run submit coroutines to the
shared loop (ADR-0013 rules 2-3), as long as the spawn path still creates
one ``_ctx_wrapped`` thread per run. If a future decision replaces the
per-run thread, ADR-0013 must be superseded first and this exact count
updated with it.

Process state
-------------
The benchmark raises the server-wide research concurrency semaphore to
its own run count. ``start_research_process``'s worker releases the
MODULE GLOBAL ``_global_research_semaphore`` resolved at exit time, not a
captured object, so the substituted semaphore is restored only after
every spawned thread has been joined — on the error path too. If a thread
is still alive, the substitution is deliberately left in place and the
run fails, because restoring first would let that thread release a permit
into the production semaphore it never took.
