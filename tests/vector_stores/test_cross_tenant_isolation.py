"""Cross-TENANT isolation: two independent users, two independent (in-memory)
DBs, two independent on-disk index directories, and — deliberately — COLLIDING
integer ``DocumentChunk.id`` values (each user's DB is a fresh autoincrement
sequence, so user A's first chunk and user B's first chunk both get id=1).

The facade's search-time rehydration (``VectorIndex.search`` in
``vector_stores/facade.py``) resolves a FAISS hit's int id to text by querying
the CALLER's own DB session for a ``DocumentChunk`` row. There is no
username/tenant column in that query — the isolation guarantee is structural:
each user's ``VectorIndex`` is wired to open (or receive) ONLY that user's own
DB session, so an id collision across tenants can never resolve to the wrong
person's text. If a future refactor ever made ``get_user_db_session`` return a
shared/global session, or made search fall back to some pooled session,
colliding ids would silently rehydrate the WRONG tenant's secret text — this
test is built so that regression fails loudly.

Mirrors the real-components fixture style of
``test_no_plaintext_production_path.py`` (fake deterministic network-free
embeddings, real ``Base.metadata.create_all`` sqlite engine, real on-disk
``VectorIndex``/``FaissVectorStore``), but parameterized per user: TWO
engines/sessions and TWO index directories, with
``vector_stores.facade.get_user_db_session`` patched to a small router that
sends each username to its OWN session — exactly mirroring how, in
production, each user's request is bound to their own SQLCipher-encrypted DB
file.
