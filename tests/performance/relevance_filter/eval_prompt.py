"""Compare multiple relevance-filter prompt variants on the same arXiv results.

Usage:
    LDR_BOOTSTRAP_ALLOW_UNENCRYPTED=true \\
    LDR_TEST_OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434 \\
    LDR_TEST_OLLAMA_MODEL=qwen3.5:9b \\
    pdm run python tests/performance/relevance_filter/eval_prompt.py

Fetches arXiv results ONCE per query and then runs the filter with each
candidate prompt variant. Prints a side-by-side comparison so a human can
judge which variant keeps the right papers and drops the right ones.

This is a dev tool — not a pytest test — because the right answer is a
human judgment, not a hard assertion.
