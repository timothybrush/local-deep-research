"""
Test backwards compatibility for encrypted databases.

This test ensures that databases created with previous versions can still
be opened with the current version. This prevents breaking changes like
salt modifications from going undetected.

The full probe installs the latest published version, creates an encrypted
database outside the checkout, and opens it with the candidate. Once explicitly
enabled, setup failures must fail the probe rather than report a skipped success.

The only exception is KNOWN_UNINSTALLABLE_RELEASES: exact published versions
whose dependency metadata pip cannot resolve. A published package cannot be
fixed, so such a version is never chosen as the predecessor; the probe still
runs against the newest stable release that is not listed. Any other install
failure fails the probe (and the release gate that requires it). If a newly
published release turns out to be uninstallable, either yank it on PyPI (yanked
files are ignored) or add its exact version here, with the reason, in a
reviewed commit.
Run it manually with:
