Tests for LibraryRAGService.index_documents_parallel.

This is the new parallel fan-out that backs the six call sites which
previously indexed documents one at a time:

  * ``rag_routes.py::_background_index_worker`` (the user-facing
    "Index" button on /library/collections/<id>)
  * ``rag_routes.py::index_collection`` SSE generator
  * ``rag_routes.py::_auto_index_documents_worker`` (post-upload
    auto-index)
  * ``rag_routes.py::index_all`` SSE generator (replaces the
    pseudo-batch in ``index_documents_batch`` with a real bounded
    pool)
  * ``scheduler/background.py::_reconcile_unindexed_documents`` (two
    branches: in-collection and orphan ingest)

Each ``index_document`` worker opens its own DB session, so this
file mocks at the ``index_document`` boundary rather than mocking
SQLAlchemy, FAISS, embeddings, etc. The behaviour we care about is
that the parallel helper:

  * delegates to ``index_document`` exactly once per doc_id,
    deduplicating repeats in the input list,
  * aggregates per-doc results into the same
    ``{successful, skipped, failed, errors, results}`` shape that
    the SSE generators consume,
  * drives an optional progress callback once per completion in
    completion order (not submission order),
  * polls an optional ``is_cancelled`` callable between completions
    and shuts the executor down with ``wait=False,
    cancel_futures=True`` when cancelled,
  * clamps ``max_workers`` to ``>= 1`` so a bad setting can never
    explode the pool,
  * never lets one doc's failure kill the run.
