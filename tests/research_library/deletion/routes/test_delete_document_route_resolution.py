"""Route-resolution invariant for DELETE /library/api/document/<id>.

``library_bp`` (url_prefix ``/library``) and ``delete_bp``
(url_prefix ``/library/api``) both used to declare a rule compiling to the
identical ``DELETE /library/api/document/<id>``. Because ``library_bp`` is
registered first (web/app_factory.py), Werkzeug resolved to its UNGUARDED
``LibraryService.delete_document`` handler, making the note-protection
guard in ``delete_bp`` dead code and letting a note Document be
hard-deleted via the document API.

The duplicate ``library_bp`` route was removed. These tests lock the
invariant so it cannot silently regress: the DELETE must resolve to the
guarded ``delete`` blueprint endpoint, and no second rule may claim the
same path+method.
