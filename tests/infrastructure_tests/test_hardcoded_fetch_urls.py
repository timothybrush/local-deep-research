"""Every fully-literal frontend ``fetch()``/XHR URL must resolve to a real
backend route.

Why this guard exists
---------------------

``test_urls_js.py`` validates the central ``URLS`` table in
``static/js/config/urls.js`` against the live app — but the frontend also
contains ~75 hardcoded ``fetch('/...')`` calls across templates and component
scripts (news-subscription-form.html alone has a dozen), plus a comparable
number of calls through the app's hardened fetch wrappers (below). Those
literals have no guard at all today, and the browser-level Puppeteer suites
run only in the release pipeline (``strict-mode``), so a renamed or removed
route breaks the UI silently and is discovered weeks later at release time.
PR #3299's own changelog shows the failure class is real: five legacy
``/api/news/*`` endpoints were removed and every hardcoded client reference
had to be found by hand.

Scope, deliberately narrow
--------------------------

Only *fully literal* first arguments are checked — ``fetch('/news/api/subscribe')``.
URLs built by interpolation (``fetch(`/api/research/${id}/status`)``), from
variables, or via the ``URLS`` table are skipped: they are not resolvable
statically, and the ``URLS`` table is already covered by ``test_urls_js.py``.
String concatenation is skipped only when it extends the *path* itself
(``fetch('/api/research/' + id + '/status')``) — the captured
``/api/research/`` fragment is not itself a URL and matches no route by
construction, so flagging it would be a false positive, not a caught bug.
Query-string concatenation is *not* skipped, in either of its two idioms:
appended to the path literal itself (``fetch('/news/api/feed?limit=' + n)``
— the path portion before the ``?`` is already complete, since the check
ignores everything from ``?`` on regardless) or concatenated as its own
separate literal (``fetch('/news/api/feed' + '?limit=' + n)`` — the
captured ``/news/api/feed`` is already the complete path, even though it
contains no ``?`` itself; see ``_is_concatenated`` for the precise rule).
Both are still resolvable and still checked. Fragment concatenation
behaves identically, since the check also ignores everything from ``#``
on: an embedded fragment (``fetch('/news/api/feed#row-' + n)``) and a
separate-literal fragment (``fetch('/news/api/feed' + '#row')``) are
both still checked too.
Generated bundles (``dist/``, ``*.min.js``) are excluded — they are build
output, not sources.

Beyond bare ``fetch()``/``XMLHttpRequest.open()``, the guard also recognises
the codebase's hardened fetch wrappers — ``safeFetch``/``safeFetchWithAuth``/
``safeFetchJson`` (static/js/security/safe-fetch.js; ``safeFetchWithAuth`` is
the wrapper the codebase now prefers for new code), ``fetchWithErrorHandling``/
``window.api.fetchWithErrorHandling`` (static/js/services/api.js), and the
smaller per-page helpers ``getJSON``/``postJSON``/``apiGet``/``apiPost``. All
of them take the URL as their first argument, exactly like ``fetch()``, so
the same literal/concatenation/interpolation rules apply unchanged — only
the set of recognised call names is wider. Skipping these wrappers would
leave a large and growing share of the app's actual HTTP surface unguarded,
since the guard's job is to catch every *resolvable* literal URL, not just
those reached via one specific call spelling.

This is the *covered* set, not a complete inventory of every URL-first
wrapper shape in the tree: it currently misses the lowercase ``postJson``
(``notes_shared.js``, case-sensitive regex), ``deleteRequest``/
``getRequest``/``postRequest`` (``delete_manager.js``), and
``_callSynthesize`` (``notes.js``) with its own literal endpoints. None of
these is unresolved today, so nothing is broken, but the guard does not see
them. #6227 tracks widening the recognised set to close this gap.

The route table is derived by AST/regex from the mounted routers rather
than by importing the app, mirroring ``test_route_table_parity.py``'s
approach: no import side effects, no dependency on a bootable environment,
and it runs everywhere. A dynamically-registered route would be missed —
the app registers none today (the parity test's snapshot pins the full
table and would flag any that appears).

A URL passes if it equals a route path (trailing-slash tolerant), matches a
parameterized route (``{id}`` → one segment, ``{path:path}`` → any suffix),
or falls under a mount prefix (``/ws``). Query strings and fragments are
ignored, as are external and non-root-relative URLs.

    """True if the matched literal is a truncated *path* fragment continued
    by string concatenation, e.g. the ``'/api/research/'`` in
    ``fetch('/api/research/' + id + '/status')``.

    Only a trailing ``+`` matters: the regexes above only ever capture the
    *first* quoted fragment of the call's arguments, so the text
    immediately before the captured quote is always ``(`` or ``,`` (the
    call's opening paren, or the comma after the XHR method) — never
    ``+``. A leading-``+`` check would therefore be dead code; it is
    omitted rather than kept as a check that can never fire.

    A trailing ``+`` alone is not enough to call the fragment incomplete,
    though. Two independent ways the rest of the path can already be
    complete before the ``+``:

    1. The captured literal itself contains a ``?`` or a ``#``:
       everything before that marker is already a complete path
       (``_normalise`` strips the query string / fragment), e.g.
       ``'<path>?param=' + value`` or ``'<path>#row-' + value``.
    2. The captured literal has *no* ``?`` or ``#``, but the very next
       token is itself a quoted literal that *starts* with ``?`` or ``#``,
       e.g. ``'/api/news/feed' + '?limit=' + n``. Here the query string is
       concatenated as its own separate literal rather than appended to
       the path literal, so the captured ``/api/news/feed`` is already the
       complete, resolvable path — even though it contains no ``?`` and is
       followed by a ``+``. Checking only the captured literal's own
       contents (case 1) misses this idiom entirely, which is exactly what
       made the guard skip (and thus never check) fragments like this one.

    Only when neither holds — no ``?``/``#`` in the captured literal,
    and the next token after the ``+`` is not a literal beginning with
    ``?``/``#`` (typically an identifier, e.g. ``... + id + '/status'``) — does the
    ``+`` genuinely extend the path itself, making the fragment
    unresolvable on its own and the case to skip.

    entirely, both of which drop the count far enough to trip it; every
    other wrapper name can silently fall out of ``_FETCH_WRAPPER_RE``
    without moving that floor at all).

    Dropping any one name from ``_FETCH_WRAPPER_RE`` fails that name's case
    here, with one caveat: dropping only the ``window.api.`` qualified
    alternative still passes, because ``\\b`` also matches immediately after
    the ``.`` in ``window.api.fetchWithErrorHandling(``, so the plain
    ``fetchWithErrorHandling`` alternative independently matches the same
    call site at a later position in the alternation. Only dropping *both*
