"""Regression: ``domain_classifier.models`` must import without a cycle.

``domain_classifier.models`` defines the ``DomainClassification`` model and
needs SQLAlchemy's ``Base``. It used to import ``Base`` from the
``..database.models`` *package*, whose ``__init__`` eagerly imports every model
— including ``DomainClassification`` back from this module. Importing
``domain_classifier.models`` first (before ``database.models`` was cached)
crashed at import time::

    ImportError: cannot import name 'DomainClassification' from partially
    initialized module 'local_deep_research.domain_classifier.models'

The fix imports ``Base`` from the dependency-free ``database.base`` leaf
instead. Because ``database`` is a namespace package (no ``__init__.py``),
importing ``database.base`` never triggers ``database.models.__init__`` — so the
eager re-import of ``DomainClassification`` is never reached. (Importing from
``database.models.base`` would NOT work: pulling any submodule of
``database.models`` first runs that package's ``__init__``, re-triggering the
cycle.) These checks import the cycle-critical modules in FRESH interpreters —
pytest's module cache would mask a real cycle within a single process (whatever
imports ``database.models`` first hides it) — and assert they load cleanly.
