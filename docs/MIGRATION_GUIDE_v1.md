# Migration Guide: LDR v0.x to v1.0

## Overview

Local Deep Research v1.0 introduces significant security and architectural improvements:

- **User Authentication**: All access now requires authentication
- **Per-User Encrypted Databases**: Each user has their own encrypted SQLCipher database
- **Settings Snapshots**: Thread-safe settings management for concurrent operations
- **New API Structure**: Reorganized endpoints under router prefixes

## Breaking Changes

### 1. Authentication Required

**v0.x**: Open access, no authentication
```python
# Direct API access
from local_deep_research.api import quick_summary
result = quick_summary("query")
```

**v1.0**: Authentication required
```python
from local_deep_research.api import quick_summary
from local_deep_research.settings import SettingsManager
from local_deep_research.database.session_context import get_user_db_session

# Must authenticate first
with get_user_db_session(username="user", password="pass") as session:
    settings_manager = SettingsManager(session)
    settings_snapshot = settings_manager.get_all_settings()

    result = quick_summary(
        "query",
        settings_snapshot=settings_snapshot  # Required parameter
    )
```

### 2. HTTP API Changes

#### Endpoint Structure
- **v0.x**: `/api/v1/quick_summary`
- **v1.0**: `/api/start_research`

#### Authentication Flow
```python
import requests

# v1.0 requires session-based authentication
session = requests.Session()

# 1. Login
session.post(
    "http://localhost:5000/auth/login",
    json={"username": "user", "password": "pass"}
)

# 2. Get CSRF token for state-changing operations
csrf = session.get("http://localhost:5000/auth/csrf-token").json()["csrf_token"]

# 3. Make API requests with CSRF token
response = session.post(
    "http://localhost:5000/api/start_research",
    json={"query": "test"},
    headers={"X-CSRF-Token": csrf}
)
```

### 3. Database Changes

#### v0.x
- Single shared database: `ldr.db`
- No encryption
- Direct database access from any thread

#### v1.0
- Per-user databases: `encrypted_databases/{username}.db`
- SQLCipher encryption with user passwords
- Thread-local session management
- In-memory queue tracking (no more service_db)

### 4. Settings Management

#### v0.x
```python
# Direct settings access
from local_deep_research.config import get_db_setting
value = get_db_setting("llm.provider")
```

#### v1.0
```python
# Settings require context
from local_deep_research.settings import SettingsManager

# Within authenticated session
settings_manager = SettingsManager(session)
value = settings_manager.get_setting("llm.provider")

# Or use settings snapshot for thread safety
settings_snapshot = settings_manager.get_all_settings()
```

## Migration Steps

### 1. Update Dependencies

```bash
pip install --upgrade local-deep-research
```

### 2. Create User Accounts

Users must create accounts through the web interface:

1. Start the server: `python -m local_deep_research.web.app`
2. Open http://localhost:5000
3. Click "Register" and create an account
4. Configure LLM providers and API keys in Settings

### 3. Update Programmatic Code

#### Before (v0.x):
```python
from local_deep_research.api import (
    quick_summary,
    detailed_research,
    generate_report
)

# Direct usage
result = quick_summary("What is AI?")
```

#### After (v1.0):
```python
from local_deep_research.api import quick_summary
from local_deep_research.settings import SettingsManager
from local_deep_research.database.session_context import get_user_db_session

def run_research(username, password, query):
    with get_user_db_session(username, password) as session:
        settings_manager = SettingsManager(session)
        settings_snapshot = settings_manager.get_all_settings()

        return quick_summary(
            query=query,
            settings_snapshot=settings_snapshot,
            # Other parameters remain the same
            iterations=2,
            questions_per_iteration=3
        )
```

### 4. Update HTTP API Calls

Create a wrapper for authenticated requests:

```python
class LDRClient:
    def __init__(self, base_url="http://localhost:5000"):
        self.base_url = base_url
        self.session = requests.Session()
        self.csrf_token = None

    def login(self, username, password):
        response = self.session.post(
            f"{self.base_url}/auth/login",
            json={"username": username, "password": password}
        )
        if response.status_code == 200:
            self.csrf_token = self.session.get(
                f"{self.base_url}/auth/csrf-token"
            ).json()["csrf_token"]
        return response

    def start_research(self, query, **kwargs):
        return self.session.post(
            f"{self.base_url}/api/start_research",
            json={"query": query, **kwargs},
            headers={"X-CSRF-Token": self.csrf_token}
        )

# Usage
client = LDRClient()
client.login("user", "pass")
result = client.start_research("What is quantum computing?")
```

### 5. Update Configuration

#### API Keys
API keys are now stored encrypted in per-user databases. Users must:
1. Login to the web interface
2. Go to Settings
3. Re-enter API keys for LLM providers

#### Custom LLMs
Custom LLM registrations now require settings context:

```python
# v1.0 custom LLM with settings support
def create_custom_llm(model_name=None, temperature=None, settings_snapshot=None):
    # Access settings from snapshot if needed
    api_key = settings_snapshot.get("llm.custom.api_key", {}).get("value")
    return CustomLLM(api_key=api_key, model=model_name, temperature=temperature)
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "No settings context available in thread"
**Solution**: Pass `settings_snapshot` parameter to all API calls

### Issue: "Encrypted database requires password"
**Solution**: Ensure you're using `get_user_db_session()` with credentials

### Issue: CSRF token errors
**Solution**: Get fresh CSRF token before state-changing requests

### Issue: Old endpoints return 404
**Solution**: Update to new endpoint structure (see mapping above)

### Issue: Rate limiting not working
**Solution**: Rate limits are now per-user; ensure proper authentication

## Backward Compatibility

For temporary backward compatibility, you can:

1. Set environment variable: `LDR_USE_SHARED_DB=1` (not recommended)
2. Create a compatibility wrapper for your existing code

```python
# compatibility.py
import os
os.environ["LDR_USE_SHARED_DB"] = "1"  # Use at your own risk

def quick_summary_compat(query, **kwargs):
    # Minimal compatibility wrapper
    # Note: This bypasses security features!
    from local_deep_research.api import quick_summary
    return quick_summary(query, settings_snapshot={}, **kwargs)
```

⚠️ **Warning**: Compatibility mode bypasses security features and is not recommended for production use.

## Benefits of v1.0

1. **Security**: Encrypted databases protect sensitive API keys and research data
2. **Multi-User**: Multiple users can work simultaneously without conflicts
3. **Performance**: Cached settings and thread-local sessions improve speed
4. **Reliability**: Thread-safe operations prevent race conditions
5. **Privacy**: User data is completely isolated

## Upgrading to the FastAPI-based Release (Phase 1)

The server has migrated from Flask + Werkzeug to FastAPI + uvicorn.
The sections below highlight the changes most likely to affect an interactive
user. They are not the complete operator checklist, and several are permanent
contract changes rather than one-time upgrade effects. Before upgrading, read
[`changelog.d/3299.breaking.md`](../changelog.d/3299.breaking.md) for the full
list, client/API migration details, and rollback procedure.

### You will need to log in again

Flask and Starlette (FastAPI's session middleware) sign session cookies
using different itsdangerous schemes, so the session cookie your browser
holds from the Flask version is not readable by the new server. You will
be redirected to the login page on first visit and must re-enter your
password. Your data is not affected — only the browser session.

### Default bind address is now `127.0.0.1`

Prior Flask-era releases bound to `0.0.0.0` (all interfaces) by default,
which silently exposed the server to the LAN or public internet. The new
default is `127.0.0.1` (localhost only). To expose the server to other
machines — for example a home server — set the environment variable
`LDR_WEB_HOST=0.0.0.0` explicitly. Docker users are unaffected: the
Dockerfile sets this env var automatically so container port mapping
still works.

### Reverse proxies must opt in to forwarded request metadata

Set `TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS=true` when TLS terminates at a trusted reverse proxy.
Without it, uvicorn keeps the request scheme as HTTP, so secure-cookie, HSTS,
and WebSocket same-origin behaviour will be wrong. Client-IP extraction for
rate limiting follows a separate rule, so the proxy must overwrite forwarded
client-IP headers even when this variable is unset. Use the hardened examples
in [Reverse proxy configuration](deployment/reverse-proxy.md).

### The Socket.IO endpoint moved to `/ws/socket.io`

The Socket.IO server is now an ASGI sub-app mounted at `/ws`
(`app.mount("/ws", socket_app)` in `web/fastapi_app.py`), and it is served
under the path `/ws/socket.io` (`socketio_path="/ws/socket.io"` in
`web/services/socketio_asgi.py`). The bundled UI already connects with
`path: '/ws/socket.io'`. If you wrote your own Socket.IO client, or if your
reverse proxy has an explicit location block for the old default
`/socket.io` path, update it — see
[Reverse proxy configuration](deployment/reverse-proxy.md).

### WebSocket cross-origin default is unchanged

`LDR_SECURITY_WEBSOCKET_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` behaves exactly as before: unset
means same-origin only. Set it explicitly if you need cross-origin WS
access (rare).

An earlier version of this section said the default was "tightened" from
`"*"` to same-origin. That was wrong — the previous release's
`web/services/socket_service.py` already fell through to a same-origin
allowlist when the variable was unset. Nothing about origin policy changed
in this migration; only the transport moved.

### SameSite cookie attribute changed from `Lax` to `Strict`

If you embed LDR inside another tool via an iframe or rely on OAuth
redirects, the session cookie may not survive the cross-site navigation.
LDR itself does not use either pattern.

There is currently **no setting or environment variable to restore `Lax`** —
`same_site="strict"` is hardcoded where `SessionMiddleware` is installed
(`web/fastapi_app.py`). If you need `Lax`, open an issue; do not expect a
config knob to exist.

### Graceful shutdown timeout is bounded (10 s)

`uvicorn.run(timeout_graceful_shutdown=10)` — in-flight SSE streams are
closed after 10 seconds when the server receives SIGTERM/SIGINT, rather
than blocking indefinitely. This is currently **hardcoded** — there is no
setting or environment variable to lengthen the drain window. If you run
very long single-request operations and need one, please open an issue.
