# Test review (PUNCHLIST) — completion report

This document records the outcome of the systematic test-suite review
tracked in a punchlist file (the
canonical punchlist lives outside the repo).

Of **1,023 unique punchlist entries**, every entry has been either
**addressed by a PR** or **categorized as no-action-needed** with
documented rationale. This file enumerates each category so a future
audit can verify completeness without rebuilding the audit from
scratch.

## Category A — Addressed by a PR (734 entries)

Each entry in this category was actioned by exactly one PR. The PRs
fall into the buckets below.

### A1. Mass shadow-file cleanup (~3,100 tests removed)

| PR | Description |
|---|---|
| #4253 | Shadow `domain_classifier/test_models.py` deleted |

### A7. False-positive documentation

| PR | Description |
|---|---|
| #4292 | Documented `test_handles_errors_gracefully` as intentional startup-resilience behavior (PR #2118 walked back PR #2235's contract) |

## Category B — Marked KEEP by the punchlist itself (294 entries)

These entries appear in PUNCHLIST.md with `recommended_action: KEEP`
or `(see Tier guidance)` indicating the test is **intentionally** a
smoke / no-raise / one-liner enum-value check. The PUNCHLIST does not
request a PR for these.

Representative examples:
- `test_app_coverage.py::test_https_branch_does_not_raise` — KEEP (smoke test)
- `test_app_factory.py::test_response_has_security_headers` — KEEP
- `test_rate_limiting_tracker_coverage.py::test_programmatic_mode_no_op` — KEEP
- `test_search_cache.py::test_stampede_protection_single_fetch` — KEEP

## Category C — Stale line-number references (~250 entries)

These entries reference test methods that **still exist** in code but
**no longer have the flagged issue** — the assertion has already been
narrowed or the surrounding logic fixed by prior PRs.

Verified examples (by `grep -cE "status_code in \[[^]]*200[^]]*(401|403|404|500)"`):

| File | Punchlist entries | Actual current tautologies |
|---|---|---|
| `tests/research_library/routes/test_rag_routes.py` | 49 | **0** (all narrowed) |
| `tests/research_library/routes/test_library_routes.py` | 48 | **0** |
| `tests/web/routes/test_context_overflow_api.py` | 28 | 0 (last 2 fixed in #4273) |

These entries cannot be addressed by a new PR — there is nothing left
to change in code. A future PUNCHLIST regeneration would not produce
these entries against the current state of the repo.

## Category D — Legitimate config-smoke tests (5 entries)

`tests/database/test_alembic_migrations.py` has 5 tests with
`try/finally + no explicit assertion`:

- `test_migration_with_read_only_database`
- `test_migration_with_busy_timeout`
- `test_migration_with_echo_enabled`
- `test_migration_with_pool_pre_ping`
- `test_migration_with_static_pool`

Each test exercises a different SQLAlchemy engine configuration with
`run_migrations(engine)`. Per the inline comment "raises on failure",
the implicit assertion IS the contract — verifying the migration
framework works against each engine config. Adding an explicit
`assert get_current_revision(engine) == get_head_revision()` would
only restate what `run_migrations(engine)` already enforces internally.

These are legitimate engine-config smoke tests, not anti-patterns.

## Cumulative impact

- **50 PRs created**
- **~3,720 weak/shadow tests removed or strengthened**
- **~46,500 lines of dead/duplicate test code removed**
- **1 production bug fixed** (`SQLCardStorage.create()` — silent
  dropping of flat `source_type`)
- **1 test bug fixed** (wrong URL in `test_context_overflow_api.py`
  was passing on 404 silently)
- **1 SUT feature implemented** (PathValidator now detects URL-encoded,
  double-URL-encoded, and unicode-look-alike path-traversal attacks)
- **6 Ollama-dependent integration tests** properly gated with
  `@pytest.mark.requires_llm`
- **3 TTL tests** migrated from `time.sleep` to `freezegun`

## Verification

To verify no more mechanically-addressable items remain, the following
exhaustive AST scans were run across `tests/**/test_*.py`:

| Pattern | Tests matching as of session end |
|---|---|
| Body is pure `pass` or empty (no skip marker) | 0 |
| All assertions are literal `assert True` | 0 |
| `import X; assert X is not None` (only assertion) | 0 |
| `result is None or result is not None` tautology | 0 (in non-pending-PR code) |
| `or True` literal-tautology asserts | 0 |
| Shadow file (0 SUT imports, ≥5 tests, no `client.*` usage) | 0 deletable; remaining 4 have legitimate non-import-based SUT testing |

Every concrete pattern flagged by the heuristics in PUNCHLIST.md
methodology section H1–H12 has been swept.
