# Upgrading to the first FastAPI-based major release

This guide covers upgrades from v1.10.7 to the first FastAPI-based major
release. The web-layer change itself adds no database schema migration, but
the release also ships database revisions newer than `0030`, the newest
revision v1.10.7 knows. Prepare a matching application and data backup before
upgrading; deploying the old image alone is not a working rollback.

To find the release's newest database revision, run this with the installed
release (inside its container for Docker deployments):

```bash
python -c "from local_deep_research.database.alembic_runner import get_head_revision; print(get_head_revision())"
```

Or list the migration files in the release's wheel; the newest revision is the
highest-numbered file:

```bash
unzip -l local_deep_research-*.whl | grep 'database/migrations/versions/0'
```

## Before upgrading

1. Record the installed package version or image digest and retain its
   deployment configuration. Use the selected release's dependencies when
   upgrading or rolling back; a newer lockfile does not describe the old release.
2. Let active research and indexing jobs finish, then stop the application
   and allow its shutdown to complete.
3. Take an offline backup of the complete configured LDR data directory,
   including databases and configuration, plus any separately configured
   document or vector storage. Verify that a copy can be restored before
   changing the production data. Each user database is encrypted with that
   user's password, which LDR does not store, so a restored copy opens only
   with the password the user had when it was taken. Tell users to keep
   their current passwords until a rollback is no longer possible; do not
   collect users' passwords yourself.
4. Review the release's compatibility notes and your reverse-proxy setup.
   Socket.IO now uses `/ws/socket.io`. A trusted TLS-terminating proxy requires
   `TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS=true` and must be the only way to reach the backend.
   Follow the [reverse-proxy guide](reverse-proxy.md), including its header
   overwrite and single-proxy requirements.

## Upgrade and verify

Install the selected release and start one application process against the
intended data directory. Users must sign in again after the restart.
Per-user database migrations run when those databases are opened; an
application health response alone does not verify every user's upgrade.

The revisions after `0030` repair existing data. For example, revision `0031`
repairs an allowlisted set of corrupted legacy settings, deduplicates setting
keys and restores their unique index. Its downgrade is intentionally a no-op:
it cannot reconstruct discarded rows or original values. Treat every revision
after `0030` as one-way and roll back from a backup. A data migration matters
for rollback even when no new application table is added.

Before reopening the service to users, verify on the upgraded installation:

- Sign-in and a representative settings save succeed.
- Existing research reports and uploaded documents remain readable.
- A new research run reaches completion with the configured model and search
  provider; progress still updates after reconnecting.
- Existing collection searches return results, and an indexing operation
  completes with the configured embedding provider.
- Shutdown completes and the same data remains usable after restarting.

Review the release notes for custom API-client changes, including the removed
legacy news routes and CSRF requirements. See the
[configuration reference](../CONFIGURATION.md) for current settings.

### Automatic pre-migration backups

When the new release opens a user database that needs migration, normally at
that user's first sign-in after the upgrade, it first tries to write an
encrypted copy of that database to the user's
[automatic backup directory](../security/database-backup.md),
`encrypted_databases/backups/<user hash>/` under the data directory. Only
users whose databases the new release has opened have such a backup. It is
encrypted with that user's password at the time of the upgrade. Do not rely
on it in place of the offline backup.

A failed pre-migration backup does not stop the migration. If the copy
cannot be made, for example because free space in the backup directory is
less than twice the database's size or the copy fails its integrity check,
the release logs a `Pre-migration backup failed` line and migrates the
database anyway. Look for that line after each user's first sign-in.
Treat a user with no `Pre-migration backup created` line for that sign-in
as having no pre-migration backup, and rely on the offline backup for that
user's rollback.

This pre-migration backup is not durable. Writing it removes the user's
older automatic backups, and later events replace or delete it. A sign-in
adds a login backup only when the user has no backup dated the current UTC
day, so only the first sign-in on each later UTC day adds one; further
sign-ins that day add nothing.

- With the default `backup.max_count` of `1`, the first login backup made on
  a later UTC day replaces it with a copy of the upgraded database. A
  sign-in shortly after midnight UTC can do this minutes after the upgrade.
- With that default, the first sign-in itself does this if it runs past
  midnight UTC: the pre-migration backup is named for the time its export
  started, and that sign-in's own login backup, made after the migration,
  then falls on a later UTC day. On a large database the export and
  migration can take minutes. After each user's first sign-in, check that the file named in
  that user's `Pre-migration backup created` log line still exists; if it
  does not, the pre-migration backup is already gone and the offline backup
  is the only rollback source for that user.
- With a higher `backup.max_count` of N, each of those login backups is
  added and only the newest N files are kept. Whichever comes first deletes
  the pre-migration backup: the Nth login backup made after it, which is
  the user's first sign-in on the Nth later UTC day on which they sign in,
  however young the backup is, or the first login backup made after it is
  older than `backup.max_age_days` (default `7`).
- A password change deletes all of that user's backups, this one included,
  and writes a new backup of the upgraded database.

After any of these, restoring from `encrypted_databases/backups/` restores
the upgraded database, not the pre-migration one, and v1.10.7 refuses it.

Copy the pre-migration backups out immediately. Each user's backup is
created at that user's own first sign-in, so there is no single moment that
covers everyone: copy each user's backup directory to storage outside the data
directory immediately after that user's first sign-in on the new release,
before their first sign-in on a later UTC day and before any password change.

Raising `backup.max_count` and `backup.max_age_days` before upgrading, for
example with the `LDR_BACKUP_MAX_COUNT` and `LDR_BACKUP_MAX_AGE_DAYS`
environment variables, only widens that window. The pre-migration backup
then survives until the user's first sign-in on the
`backup.max_count`-th later UTC day on which they sign in, or until the
first login backup after it is older than `backup.max_age_days`, whichever
comes first, and a password change still deletes it at any time. With
`LDR_BACKUP_MAX_COUNT=5`, a user who signs in daily loses it on the fifth
day after the upgrade even if `backup.max_age_days` is `90`; signing in
several times a day does not bring that forward. It is not a substitute for
copying the backups out.

Protect the copies you take, and the offline backup, as you protect the
data directory. Each copy opens with the password its user had when it was
taken, and keeps doing so after the user changes that password. LDR deletes
a user's automatic backups on a password change for that reason, but it
cannot reach copies made outside the data directory. Restrict access to
them, destroy them once a rollback to v1.10.7 is no longer needed, and
destroy a user's copies at once if that user changes a password because it
may have been compromised. The offline backup has the same exposure, and
that user's rollback then relies on it alone.

Backup file names start with their UTC creation time
(`ldr_backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`), and the log records each
`Pre-migration backup created` path. A backup created before the upgrade is
not a pre-migration backup, and one created at a later sign-in on the new
release is a copy of the upgraded database.

## Rollback

Never start v1.10.7 against the upgraded data directory. v1.10.7 knows
revisions only through `0030`. Each sign-in with the correct password against
a database stamped with a newer revision first makes a forced backup and keeps
only the newest backup file for that user. That replaces the user's automatic
pre-migration backup with a copy of the upgraded database. Then v1.10.7
refuses the login with `Can't locate revision identified by '<revision>'`.

1. Stop the upgraded application.
2. Before any downgrade attempt, copy every user's backups from
   `encrypted_databases/backups/` to storage outside the data directory, if
   you have not already copied the pre-migration backups. Preserve the
   upgraded data separately as well if post-upgrade work needs later
   recovery.
3. Restore the verified pre-upgrade offline backup. If you have none, restore
   each migrated user's database from the pre-migration backup you copied
   out after the upgrade; see the
   [database backup guide](../security/database-backup.md). A user whose
   first sign-in logged `Pre-migration backup failed`, or no
   `Pre-migration backup created` line, has no pre-migration backup to
   restore from.
   Check each file's timestamp first: a backup taken now from
   `encrypted_databases/backups/` is a copy of the upgraded database if a
   later daily backup or a password change has replaced the pre-migration
   one, and v1.10.7 refuses it. A database the new release never opened was
   not migrated and needs no restore. Accounts created on the new release
   have no pre-upgrade copy: the offline backup does not contain them, and
   v1.10.7 refuses their databases, which the new release created at its
   newest revision. Export anything those users need before rolling back.
   After the restore, each user signs in with the password they had when
   the restored copy was taken.
4. Deploy the matching previous application version and configuration.

Do not run the old and new versions against the same writable data directory.
Work saved after the backup will not be present in that restored copy.
Manually changing the revision marker or invoking the no-op downgrades does
not restore the previous data; use the backup for this rollback procedure.

Restore custom Socket.IO clients and proxy rules to `/socket.io`. If you adopted
`RATE_LIMIT_STORAGE_URI`, also restore or retain `RATELIMIT_STORAGE_URL` for the
old release. Keep the backend isolated behind the proxy. Users must sign in
again, and interrupted work may need to be restarted.
