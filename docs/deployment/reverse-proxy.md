# Deploying behind a reverse proxy

For anything beyond a single user on `localhost`, run LDR behind a reverse proxy
(nginx, Caddy, Traefik, Nginx Proxy Manager, …). The proxy terminates TLS and
handles **HTTPS, response compression, and static-asset caching** for you — so
LDR itself does none of those (see
[ADR-0005](../decisions/0005-reject-inapp-response-compression.md) on why
compression is intentionally the proxy's job, not the app's).

> **Bind LDR to loopback and expose only the proxy.** LDR's default
> `LDR_WEB_HOST` is `127.0.0.1` (loopback only, changed from `0.0.0.0` in the
> FastAPI release) and it always serves **plain HTTP**. That default is what
> you want behind a proxy on the same host. For Docker — where the container's
> loopback is not reachable from the host — set `LDR_WEB_HOST=0.0.0.0` and
> publish to loopback instead (`-p 127.0.0.1:5000:5000`), or use an internal
> network. This matters for security — see the next section.

The config below is **illustrative**; directive syntax evolves, so follow the
linked upstream docs for the current spelling. `5000` is LDR's default port
(`LDR_WEB_PORT`); substitute yours if you changed it.

## What LDR expects from the proxy

> **Changed in the FastAPI release — action required.** LDR previously applied
> Werkzeug's `ProxyFix` unconditionally, so forwarded headers were *always*
> trusted. Uvicorn now honours forwarded request metadata only when you opt in
> with **`TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS=true`** (`true`/`1`/`yes` are accepted). Without
> it, the request scheme remains
> plain HTTP behind a TLS-terminating proxy: the session cookie loses its
> `Secure` flag, HSTS is withheld, and the WebSocket same-origin check rejects
> `https` origins. Set it in the environment of the LDR process (note: no
> `LDR_` prefix — it is read at startup, before settings are loaded).

Rate-limit client-IP extraction is a separate application-level path. It reads
`X-Forwarded-For` (or, when that is absent, `X-Real-IP`) when
`TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS` is enabled **or** when the direct peer is
private/loopback, so a local proxy works before the uvicorn opt-in. The proxy
must therefore **overwrite** both client-IP headers with the address it
observed, never pass a client-supplied value through. The one-hop nginx example
below does that by setting both to `$remote_addr`. Overwriting pins
`X-Forwarded-For` to a single entry and `X-Real-IP` to the proxy's own value,
and it keeps uvicorn's client address under `TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS` (the
*left-most* entry) equal to the rate limiter's key (the *right-most* entry).

| Forwarded header | Used by LDR? | For |
|---|---|---|
| `X-Forwarded-For` | yes | client IP for rate limiting; the trusted proxy must overwrite it |
| `X-Real-IP` | fallback | client IP when `X-Forwarded-For` is absent; overwrite or clear it too |
| `X-Forwarded-Proto` | with `TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS` | http/https detection → secure cookies, HSTS, the WebSocket same-origin check |
| `X-Forwarded-Host` | ignored | — |
| `X-Forwarded-Port` | ignored | — |

This means:

- **Your proxy must set `X-Forwarded-Proto`.** Without it, a TLS-terminating
  proxy makes LDR think the request is plain HTTP — secure cookies and HSTS are
  withheld and the same-origin WebSocket check rejects the browser's `https`
  origin.
- **Overwrite `X-Forwarded-For` and `X-Real-IP`** with the address observed by
  the one trusted proxy. With the overwrite form shown below the header carries
  a single entry. LDR's rate limiter keys on the right-most `X-Forwarded-For`
  entry (the one added by the nearest proxy, also across repeated header
  lines), so a single *appending* proxy cannot be steered by a client-supplied
  prefix either. Overwriting remains the supported configuration: it also
  pins `X-Real-IP`, and under `TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS` uvicorn takes the
  *left-most* entry as the client address, which only the overwrite form makes
  trustworthy. An entry that is not an IP address (an optional `:port`, or
  `[IPv6]:port`, is accepted and dropped) is ignored, and the key falls back to
  the request's client address. If that client address is itself not an IP
  address, every such request shares one fixed `unparseable-peer` bucket.
- **`TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS=true` makes uvicorn trust forwarded request
  metadata.** Only set it
  when LDR is reachable *exclusively* through your proxy. If LDR is also
  reachable directly, a client can forge `X-Forwarded-For` (to spoof its IP and
  evade rate limiting) or `X-Forwarded-Proto: https` (to force secure cookies
  over plaintext). This is why LDR must be bound to loopback / an internal
  network. Without the variable set, forwarded headers from a *public* peer are
  ignored by uvicorn, but the rate limiter still honours client-IP headers
  from a private/loopback peer. That distinction is why the overwrite rule
  above applies even before you opt in.
- **Exactly one proxy hop is supported.** `TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS` is a boolean,
  not a hop count, so a multi-proxy chain or a CDN/Cloudflare Tunnel *in
  addition* to your proxy is not supported without a code change. LDR keys on
  the right-most forwarded entry, which behind a chain (CDN → nginx) is the
  outer hop's address: every client collapses into that one rate-limit bucket
  unless the inner proxy overwrites the header with the real client IP it has
  verified. (uvicorn's own client address under `TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS` is the
  left-most entry; the rate limiter uses it only as the fallback when the
  forwarded header it reads carries no usable address, and when that entry is
  not an IP address either, the shared `unparseable-peer` bucket instead.)
- **HSTS and HTTPS redirect:** LDR sends `Strict-Transport-Security`
  (`max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains`, no `preload`) itself on HTTPS
  requests, so don't add a duplicate at the proxy. Do add an HTTP→HTTPS redirect
  at the proxy (shown below).

Content-hashed bundles under `/static/dist/` are sent with
`Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable` (the cache key is the
content hash in the *filename*, e.g. `app.<hash>.js`), so browsers cache them
without revalidating. Don't add `proxy_cache` to `location /`: LDR is a
multi-user app with per-user encrypted databases, and caching authenticated
pages there would leak one user's data to another.

## Caddy

Caddy auto-provisions TLS, redirects HTTP→HTTPS, sets `X-Forwarded-For`/`-Proto`
on [`reverse_proxy`](https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/directives/reverse_proxy)
automatically, and upgrades WebSockets transparently — so the whole deployment
is a few lines:

```caddy
ldr.example.com {
    encode gzip               # compression LDR no longer does (ADR-0005)
    reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:5000
}
```

[Automatic HTTPS](https://caddyserver.com/docs/automatic-https) requires
`ldr.example.com` to be a real public domain whose DNS points at the host, with
inbound ports 80 and 443 reachable for the ACME challenge and a writable data
directory. For an internal/non-public hostname Caddy falls back to its
locally-trusted internal CA (browsers warn unless you trust its root).

## Notes

- **Single backend only.** LDR doesn't support horizontal scaling — multiple
  replicas would need Socket.IO sticky sessions and a shared message queue.
- **Lock down registration** if you expose LDR publicly: it ships its own auth,
  but `LDR_APP_ALLOW_REGISTRATIONS` defaults to **true** (open self-signup). Set
  `LDR_APP_ALLOW_REGISTRATIONS=false` after creating your accounts. Proxy-level
  basic-auth is usually unnecessary given the built-in auth.
- **Other proxies:** Traefik (set its forwarded-headers trusted IPs),
  [Nginx Proxy Manager](unraid.md), or a tunnel. Note **Cloudflare Tunnel adds a
  second hop**, which conflicts with the fixed one-proxy trust model above.
