## Overview

The Research Library allows you to:
- **Upload documents** (PDFs, text files, markdown)
- **Organize into collections** for different projects or topics
- **Index for semantic search** using RAG (vector embeddings)
- **Search your documents** using natural language queries

Access the library at: `http://localhost:5000/library`

## Managing Documents

### Supported File Types

| Format | Extension | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| PDF | `.pdf` | Text extracted automatically |
| Plain Text | `.txt` | Direct text storage |
| Markdown | `.md`, `.markdown` | Rendered as text |
| HTML | `.html`, `.htm` | Tags stripped, text extracted |
| Word | `.docx` (and `.doc`*) | Text extracted via `unstructured` |
| OpenDocument Text | `.odt` | Text extracted via `unstructured` |
| PowerPoint | `.pptx` (and `.ppt`*) | Slide text extracted |
| Excel | `.xlsx`, `.xls` | Cell text extracted |
| Rich Text | `.rtf` | Text extracted |
| EPUB | `.epub` | Text extracted |
| Email | `.eml` | Body text extracted |
| Data | `.csv`, `.tsv`, `.json`, `.yaml`, `.yml`, `.xml`, `.toml` | Parsed to text |
| Notebooks | `.ipynb` | Cell sources and outputs |
| Web archives | `.mhtml`, `.mht` | Saved web pages |

The upload dialog's file picker is populated from the live list of formats the
server can actually parse (`GET /library/api/config/supported-formats`), so it
only offers formats whose parser dependencies are installed.

\* The legacy binary formats `.doc` and `.ppt` are offered **only** when
LibreOffice (`soffice`) is installed, because `unstructured` converts them to
the modern format with it. Image formats (`.png`, `.jpg`, …) are offered
**only** when the optional OCR extras (`pytesseract` plus the `tesseract`
system binary) are installed. The default Docker image ships neither, so those
formats are not offered there.

### Uploading Documents

1. Navigate to **Library** in the sidebar
2. Click **Upload** or drag files into the upload area
3. Select a collection (or use the default "Library")
4. Documents are processed and text is extracted

### Storage Modes

| Mode | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Database** | PDFs stored encrypted in SQLCipher | Default, most secure |
| **Text-only** | Only extracted text stored | Save space |

### Document Actions

- **View** - Open document details and extracted text
- **Download PDF** - Get original file (if stored)
- **Download Text** - Export extracted text
- **Delete** - Remove from library

---

## Collections

Collections organize your documents into groups.

### Creating a Collection

1. Go to **Library** → **Collections**
2. Click **Create Collection**
3. Enter a name and optional description
4. Click **Create**

### Managing Collections

- **Add documents** - Upload directly to collection or move existing docs
- **Remove documents** - Documents can exist in multiple collections
- **Delete collection** - Choose to keep or delete orphaned documents
- **Index collection** - Build RAG index for semantic search

### Default Collection

The "Library" collection is created automatically and serves as the default destination for uploads.

---

## RAG Indexing

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) enables semantic search over your documents.

### How It Works

```
Document → Split into Chunks → Generate Embeddings → Store in Vector Index
```

1. **Chunking** - Documents split into overlapping segments
2. **Embedding** - Each chunk converted to a vector using AI model
3. **Indexing** - Vectors stored in FAISS for fast similarity search

### Indexing a Collection

1. Go to **Library** → **Collections**
2. Select a collection
3. Click **Index for Search** (or **Rebuild Index**)
4. Wait for indexing to complete (progress shown)

### Index Status

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Not Indexed** | Documents not searchable |
| **Indexing** | Currently processing |
| **Indexed** | Ready for semantic search |
| **Needs Reindex** | New documents added since last index |

---

## Semantic Search

Once indexed, search your documents using natural language.

### Using Collection Search

1. Select a collection with indexed documents
2. Enter a natural language query
3. Results ranked by semantic similarity

### Using in Research

When conducting research, you can:
1. Set search tool to your collection name
2. LDR will search your documents instead of the web
3. Combine with web search via the default langgraph-agent strategy, which can query your collections and web engines in the same run

Example with Python API:
```python
from local_deep_research.api import quick_summary

result = quick_summary(
    query="What does the documentation say about authentication?",
    search_tool="my_collection",  # Use your collection name
    programmatic_mode=True
)
```

## Embedding Models

Choose the embedding model based on your needs.

### Available Providers

#### Sentence Transformers (Local - Default)

Runs locally with no API key. Curated Sentence Transformers models, including
the recommended default, require a one-time policy-authorized download and are
then reused from the local cache.

| Model | Dimensions | Best For |
|-------|------------|----------|
| `Alibaba-NLP/gte-modernbert-base` | 768 | Recommended default; higher-quality English retrieval and longer inputs |
| `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` | 384 | General use (fast) |
| `all-mpnet-base-v2` | 768 | Higher quality |
| `multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1` | 384 | Q&A tasks |
| `paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2` | 384 | Multi-language |

On **Library → Embedding Settings**, temporarily use **Public only**, or
**Adaptive** with a public primary and no private collection selected. Turn
off **Require local embeddings** if you enabled it, select the model, and use
**Test Embedding Model**. Once the test succeeds, return to your preferred
scope; subsequent inference uses the local cache. Collection content is not
used for this test.

New Hugging Face downloads are restricted to the vetted entries above.
Existing cached models outside that list and confined local models can be
reused offline when compatible with safetensors weights and disabled remote
code. Binary-only weights and models requiring remote Python code to be enabled
are not supported by this provider. For an existing model, supply a trusted
compatible safetensors export under the application's models directory, or use
Ollama.
Local model paths must resolve inside that directory and load without network
access. A model directory there that resolves inside the models directory
takes precedence in every scope, including when its name matches a catalog
entry, and the substitution is written to the policy audit log. A symlink
there that points outside the models directory is ignored, and the curated
Hub model of that name is used instead. Arbitrary server paths are refused.

If a download was interrupted, repeat the test under an authorized public
scope to repair missing files. Existing cached legacy models are repaired at
their cached revision, without advancing to newer model bytes. Repair requires
a known immutable revision; models outside the catalog remain cache-only.
If configuration and module metadata are both missing, the local Hub reference
still pins repair to the cached revision. Existing cache state with no single
trustworthy revision is refused instead of silently advancing the model behind
an index. To recover, either delete that model's cache directory (its
`models--...` folder under the Hugging Face cache) and download it again under
a public-capable scope — only when no collection was indexed with it — or place
a trusted copy under the application's models directory and select that,
or select a different model.
Use Ollama for a broader choice of locally managed embedding models.

#### Ollama (Local)

Uses your local Ollama installation.

- Default model: `nomic-embed-text`
- Requires Ollama running locally
- Configure URL in Settings → LLM → Ollama
- Recommended when you want a wider choice of local embedding models

#### OpenAI (Cloud)

Uses OpenAI's embedding API.

- Default model: `text-embedding-3-small`
- Requires OpenAI API key
- Higher quality, requires internet

### Changing Embedding Model

1. Go to **Library** → **Embedding Settings**
2. Select provider and model
3. Use **Test Embedding Model** before indexing; changes save automatically

> **Note:** Changing models requires reindexing existing collections.

## Troubleshooting

### Documents Not Appearing

- Check file format is supported
- Verify upload completed successfully
- Refresh the library page

### Search Not Working

- Ensure collection is indexed (check status)
- Try rebuilding the index
- Check embedding model is configured

### Slow Indexing

- Large documents take longer
- Consider using smaller chunk sizes
- Local embedding models are slower than cloud

### Memory Issues

- Reduce chunk size
- Index fewer documents at once
- Use a lighter embedding model
