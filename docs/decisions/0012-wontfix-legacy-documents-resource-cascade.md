# ADR-0012: Wontfix — legacy `documents.resource_id` CASCADE FK (v1.3.0–v1.3.58 DBs)

**Date:** 2026-09-12
**Status:** Accepted (wontfix — residual risk tracked in [#6300](https://github.com/LearningCircuit/local-deep-research/issues/6300))

## Context

Databases whose `documents` table was created by an installed version from
**v1.3.0** (2025-12-07 — the first release containing the `Document` model's
introduction, commit `590e0112c`) through **v1.3.58** inclusive (the last
release before the fix) declare the `documents.resource_id` foreign key with
`ON DELETE CASCADE` at the **schema level**. **v1.3.59** is the first release
containing the model fix, PR
[#2587](https://github.com/LearningCircuit/local-deep-research/pull/2587) /
commit `2033f977e`. PR #2587 changed the model to `SET NULL` — deleting a
`ResearchResource` was supposed to orphan the `Document` instead of deleting
it — but no migration reconciled existing databases. Exposure is a property
of the *installed version* that first created the database, not of the
calendar date it was created: a `v1.3.0`–`v1.3.58` install first run months
after v1.3.59 shipped still creates a CASCADE-shaped `documents` table.

PR [#3772](https://github.com/LearningCircuit/local-deep-research/pull/3772)
(a follow-up to the investigation of user issue
[#3747](https://github.com/LearningCircuit/local-deep-research/issues/3747))
proposed exactly that migration: detect the FK's actual `on_delete` via
`PRAGMA foreign_key_list(documents)`, conditionally rebuild the table with
`SET NULL` through Alembic `batch_alter_table`, no-op on already-fixed DBs,
verify the result. That core design is sound, confirmed empirically by
replaying the branch's upgrade under the current migration runner (FK
enforcement off during the window, evidence 5; 2026-09-12): aligned
legacy databases converted correctly (rows, FKs, and indexes preserved),
the already-fixed schema was a no-op, and repeated application was
idempotent. The literal file is not reusable verbatim: its revision
(`0011`) now conflicts with the migration line (head `0030`), so reuse
requires renumbering/re-parenting onto the current head, and it must be
hardened with both alignment-aware settlement before the rebuild and a
failing `PRAGMA foreign_key_check` after it (evidence 5 details both;
the file as written does neither: the replay showed it converts the
FK while leaving missing-resource orphan rows and the resulting
`foreign_key_check` violations in place). The branch nevertheless went
stale (draft, conflicting, migration numbering superseded twice by a main
that advanced to `0030`), which forced a cost/benefit re-examination rather
than a rote rebase — the disposition complement to the long-lived-branch
guidance in [ADR-0008](0008-reviewing-long-lived-migration-branches.md),
which governs branches that are pursued.

## Evidence

1. **The FK could not fire for most of its existence.** SQLite enforces
   foreign keys only when `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON` is set per connection.
   This application enabled that pragma in **v1.6.0** (published 2026-04-25;
   the enabling change, commit `3b1d6c6b2`, landed 2026-04-20 via PR
   [#3081](https://github.com/LearningCircuit/local-deep-research/pull/3081)).
   Migration 0007's notes — written about the `download_tracker` cascades,
   but stating the app-wide timing — say *"cascade was inert before
   v1.6.0"*. For the entire creation window the DB-level actions were
   inert, but not every resource delete left a dangling `resource_id`:
   the ORM's individual-resource delete still nulled `Document.resource_id`
   before deleting the resource (the shield of evidence 2, independent of
   pragma state), and pre-v1.6.0 bulk history deletion did not cascade
   into `research_resources`; only direct, raw, or manual deletion of a
   resource row could leave a document FK dangling.

2. **The reachable blast radius is narrow, and one of its two paths is
   shielded by the ORM.** Verified empirically (2026-09-12, in-memory
   SQLite with the pragma on, against the imported production models —
   all relationships live — and the legacy schema confirmed via
   `PRAGMA foreign_key_list(documents)`):
   - *Individual-resource delete* — the sole ORM path is
     `web/services/resource_service.py::delete_resource`. The model has
     carried `Document.resource = relationship("ResearchResource",
     backref="documents")` since the `Document` model's introduction
     (commit `590e0112c`); PR
     [#2582](https://github.com/LearningCircuit/local-deep-research/pull/2582)
     (2026-03-07) only *modified* that line, adding
     `foreign_keys="[Document.resource_id]"` to disambiguate it — forced by
     the reverse FK `ResearchResource.document_id` that the same PR
     introduced. With SQLAlchemy's default `passive_deletes=False`, on flush
     the ORM nulls `resource_id` **before** deleting the resource, so the
     DB-level CASCADE never fires — the document survives with
     `resource_id = NULL`, the same outcome as the fixed schema. This shield
   has held since the model's introduction; there was never a window in
   which the individual-delete path cascade-deleted the document. One
   mechanism nuance: the governing knob is the *collection-side* backref
   (`ResearchResource.documents`) — adding `passive_deletes=True` there
   (a documented SQLAlchemy optimization for CASCADE schemas) silently
   disarms the shield on legacy databases, while the same flag on
   `Document.resource` alone does not. The shield is a load-bearing
   invariant, not an incidental default; pinning it with a regression test
   is tracked in #6300.
   - *Research-session delete* — not one path but seven, all bulk
     `Query.delete()` calls on `ResearchHistory` that bypass ORM cascade
     handling; wherever the deleted session holds data, DB-level actions
     fire the identical chain: resources die (CASCADE, all DBs) and the
     session's documents die (`Document.research_id` is CASCADE on
     **all** databases — uniform behavior, out of scope for this record).
     Three of the seven are potentially data-bearing:
     `web/routers/research.py::delete_research` (single session);
     `web/routers/research.py::clear_history` (`:1696-1705`, all deletable
     sessions at once); and `chat/service.py::delete_attempt`
     (`:1085-1087`). The remaining four are rollback-only:
     `web/routers/chat.py::_cleanup_chat_send_rows`,
     `web/routers/research.py::_start_research_sync` (`:1336-1338`), and
     `web/routers/followup.py::_start_followup_sync` (`:463-465` and
     `:572-574`, two distinct deletes within that one function). Those
     four remove a newly created placeholder session before research
     starts, so resources and documents cannot exist there and their
     current blast radius is zero. None of the seven
     deletes `research_resources` directly, and the blast radius is
     unchanged across the three potentially data-bearing sites — the
     legacy FK adds marginal damage only for documents whose `resource_id`
     points into the deleted session while their `research_id` does not; current
     code sets `resource_id` once at creation and never re-points it, so
     such divergence is not manufactured today.
   - No other deletion route to `research_resources` exists under
     `src/local_deep_research/` — beyond the ORM `delete_resource` path
     above, no direct, bulk, or raw-SQL deletion of `ResearchResource`
     rows exists, and no ORM `session.delete()` of a `ResearchHistory`
     exists either (which would ORM-cascade through `resources`), so the
     ORM-cascade route to resource deletion is unused (verified September
     2026 by sweeping `session.delete(`, `Query.delete(`, and raw-SQL
     patterns; code paths in this record are package-relative to that
     directory).

3. **Zero reports.** GitHub issue search (documents
   disappeared/lost/gone/empty, cascade, resource delete) and a web search
   (Reddit, HN, release notes) surface no user reports of this behavior —
   including ~4.5 months in which the FK has actually been enforced. The
   original defect was found by code review in PR
   [#2582](https://github.com/LearningCircuit/local-deep-research/pull/2582),
   not by a user. This null result carries limited weight: silent loss with
   no error or log is structurally hard for victims to report, discovery
   lags the trigger by months, and Discord/Reddit were not searchable.

4. **The exposed cohort pre-dates most of the user base.** Wayback Machine
   snapshots put the project at ~3.5k stars (Oct 2025) → ~4.1k (Mar 2026),
   versus ~9k today. The vulnerable schema shape shipped in releases for ~3
   months (v1.3.0, 2025-12-07 → v1.3.58, 2026-03-03); the majority of current
   and surviving legacy databases keep shrinking through reinstall and
   container volume recreation.

5. **The bounded benefit does not justify a migration for this cohort.**
   A batch rebuild of `documents` per se has shipped precedent — migration
   `0015` (PR
   [#4643](https://github.com/LearningCircuit/local-deep-research/pull/4643))
   rebuilt the table to drop the `notes` column on every production database
   without incident — so the operation is not unprecedented. The concrete
   differential is a bounded migration precondition, narrower than "any
   rebuild": legacy databases can carry orphaned `resource_id` values —
   ORM-path deletes were shielded even in the inert era, but raw-SQL or
   manual resource deletes left them unreconciled while FK enforcement
   was off. The standard migration runner disables FK enforcement for
   the migration window (`_disable_fk_for_migration`,
   `database/alembic_runner.py:267-307`) and re-arms it afterwards
   without validating existing rows (`_restore_fk_after_migration`,
   `:310-353` — no `PRAGMA foreign_key_check`), so a safe rebuild needs
   both controls. Before the rebuild, settle alignment by nulling
   `resource_id` whenever the referenced resource is missing or its
   `research_id` does not equal the document's:

   ```sql
   UPDATE documents SET resource_id = NULL
   WHERE resource_id IS NOT NULL AND NOT EXISTS (
       SELECT 1 FROM research_resources
       WHERE research_resources.id = documents.resource_id
         AND research_resources.research_id = documents.research_id);
   ```

   The `=` treats a document with NULL `research_id` as misaligned
   (`NULL = x` is never true, and `ResearchResource.research_id` is
   `nullable=False`, so only the document side can be NULL). After the
   rebuild, `PRAGMA foreign_key_check` must return no rows or the
   migration fails. Neither control suffices alone: an existence-only
   cleanup (`resource_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM research_resources)`)
   misses divergent links, which remain FK-valid because the resource
   row exists; a check alone fails the migration on missing-resource
   orphans instead of fixing them, and it cannot detect divergence at
   all for that same reason.
   A nameable precondition, not a categorical barrier. Against a defect
   whose only ORM path is shielded (evidence 2), whose bulk-path
   exposure requires link divergence current code does not create, and
   which has zero recorded victims, even that bounded cost does not
   clear the bar.

6. **Precedent.** The codebase already tolerates legacy schema drift:
   migration 0005 deliberately did not enforce
   `research_resources.document_id` on existing databases (SQLite
   batch-alter limitation; see the model comment in
   `database/models/research.py`). Fresh installs and legacy installs
   already differ in FK shape.

## Decision

Close PR #3772 as **wontfix** — the migration will not be ported, and no
schema-reconciliation migration will be authored for databases whose
`documents` table was created by a `v1.3.0`–`v1.3.58` install. Track the
residual risk in issue
[#6300](https://github.com/LearningCircuit/local-deep-research/issues/6300),
which records: the affected version range; the guard condition, which names
the invariants this decision depends on — (1) **no new deletion route
or call site beyond the analyzed baseline (the seven existing bulk
`ResearchHistory` delete call sites documented in evidence 2), and no
semantic expansion or modification of an existing route, may reach
`research_resources` rows, directly or via cascade from ancestor
tables, while skipping the ORM null-out shield** (a semantic
invariant, not a syntax blacklist): any such deletion fires the armed
CASCADE on legacy DBs, whether legacy `Query.delete()`, SQLAlchemy 2
`session.execute(delete(...))` or Core DML, raw SQL, a database
trigger, or an ancestor cascade; (2) **no code
path that creates or updates a `Document` with `resource_id` set while
`research_id` is NULL or points to a different research session than
the one the `resource_id` belongs to**; (3) **the ORM must keep nulling
`Document.resource_id` before any ORM delete of a `ResearchResource`**,
which requires the `Document.resource` ↔ `ResearchResource.documents`
relationship pair/backref to remain in place (removal or rename that
drops the collection relationship triggers review as well) and
prohibits on that pair any `passive_deletes` value that disables the
null-out, `viewonly`, `lazy="noload"`, and `delete`/`delete-orphan`
cascade behavior, each of which silently disarms the ORM shield; and
(4) **`Document.research_id` remains `ON DELETE CASCADE` uniformly
across model-created and migrated schemas** (the marginal-damage
comparison depends on that uniformity, so any model or migration change
to it also triggers re-review) — any invariant breaking must be reviewed
against this ADR;
user guidance (individual-resource deletes through the application are
shielded by the ORM today; before recreating a database for any reason,
preserve an encrypted full-database backup as described in
[Database Backup](../security/database-backup.md); report export is not a
substitute, since it omits library documents and notes; and the default
Max Backups setting of 1 means the pre-recreation backup should be copied
outside the managed backup directory before a later automatic backup
replaces it); and the retained core migration design, to be
renumbered/re-parented to the then-current head and hardened with both
alignment-aware settlement before the rebuild and a failing
`PRAGMA foreign_key_check` after it, rather than reused verbatim,
should a real victim ever surface.

## Consequences

- Through current application paths, users on legacy databases who delete an
  individual research resource do **not** lose the linked document — it
  survives with `resource_id = NULL`, identical to the fixed schema's
  behavior. The model/schema divergence is real but has no unshielded
  trigger under `src/local_deep_research/` as of 2026-09-12.
- The armed CASCADE remains latent on those databases: a bulk deletion of
  research history (or any future bulk/raw-SQL resource deletion) fires it.
  For documents whose `resource_id` and `research_id` point at the same
  session — the case current code always produces — the fixed schema
  deletes those same `Document` rows anyway, via `Document.research_id`'s
  own CASCADE (present on all databases); the legacy FK changes nothing
  there. The legacy-only marginal damage — deleting a document the fixed
  schema would instead orphan with `resource_id = NULL` — is confined to
  the divergence case: `resource_id` pointing into the deleted session while
  `research_id` does not. Issue #6300 records this as the review trigger for
  new deletion paths.
- Second-order blast radius, gated on that same divergence condition:
  migrations `0021` and `0022` (notes-v2, applied on every database) attach
  `ON DELETE CASCADE` foreign keys from several notes tables to
  `documents.id` — `0021_add_note_tables.py:65,125,131,172,285` and
  `0022_add_note_references.py:62,69`, including `note_links` and
  `note_references`' `target_document_id` columns, which can point at a
  research-downloaded document. Any document the legacy CASCADE removes in
  the divergence case also removes its note links via those FKs.
- These guards bind application code only. Ad-hoc SQL executed against the
  database file by users or external tools (some of which enforce FKs by
  default) remains unsafe on legacy schemas and is accepted as residual
  risk — the one residual only the declined migration would fully close.
- One verified secondary hazard sits inside that same accepted residual: on
  a legacy database where manual or raw deletion left a dangling
  `resource_id`, SQLite can later reuse the deleted integer
  `ResearchResource.id` for a new resource, silently reattaching the document
  to it and misattributing its title, URL, and content. No current
  application path creates that dangling state; tracked in #6300.
- The affected cohort is expected to shrink overall (database recreation,
  attrition of pre-fix installs), but the decline is not strictly monotonic:
  a stale `v1.3.0`–`v1.3.58` installation can still create a new affected
  database. Current-version installs are correct from `create_all()`.
- No reliable automatic post-hoc detector exists: a fired CASCADE leaves no
  violating row, so lost documents surface only through a corroborated victim
  report or a backup comparison. Reopen this decision on either of those, or
  on a proposed code change that breaks a guard invariant; the response
  remains issue #6300 plus the retained #3772 core approach, renumbered
  and re-parented to the then-current migration head and hardened with
  both alignment-aware settlement before the rebuild and a failing
  `PRAGMA foreign_key_check` after it; not a verbatim reuse of the #3772
  file, and not a new investigation.
- Reviewers should not treat this specific divergence ("model says SET NULL
  but legacy schema says CASCADE", for `documents.resource_id` on databases
  whose `documents` table was created by a `v1.3.0`–`v1.3.58` install,
  regardless of when that install first ran) as an open defect; this record
  is the decision that it is accepted drift. New model/schema FK divergences
  remain open defects.
