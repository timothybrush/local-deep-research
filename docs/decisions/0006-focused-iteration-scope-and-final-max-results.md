## Context

PR #4850 (originally "fix(focused-iteration): resolve state leak, add
truncation ceiling and correct citation offset") bundled three independent
changes to `advanced_search_system/strategies/focused_iteration_strategy.py`.
Two are genuine bug fixes; the third re-introduces a change we have already
rejected twice. This ADR records the per-change verdict and the surrounding
history so we do not re-litigate it a fourth time.

`focused-iteration` is one of the five production strategies that remain after
#4420 removed ~22 experimental ones (and #4548 later removed `mcp`). It is the documented 96.51%-SimpleQA strategy
(see the module docstring), but it is **not** the primary direction anymore: the
default strategy is now **`langgraph-agent`**. langgraph-agent is considered the
more flexible and stronger-performing option — it can drive multiple tools and
adapt its approach per query — and it is the recommended path when there is
enough VRAM to run a capable model (or a hosted model is used). `focused-iteration`
remains supported and strong for SimpleQA-style factual lookups, but it is a
secondary path. So the bar for changing it is "fix real bugs, change behaviour as
little as possible" — not "make it converge with `source-based`."

## The three changes in PR #4850

### 1. State-leak reset — **ACCEPT**

```python
# top of analyze_topic()
self.all_search_results = []
self.results_by_iteration = {}
```

In report ("detailed") mode the **same** strategy instance handles every
subsection sequentially (`report_generator.py:476-493`, which also pins
`max_iterations=1` per subsection). On `main`, `all_search_results` was never
reset, so subsection *N* synthesised over subsections 1..*N* combined →
unbounded growth → context-window overflow (issue #4851).

Why we want it: it is the actual root cause. Three independent reviewers
confirmed the reset fixes the leak and introduces no new cross-subsection
corruption. Residual un-reset state (`explorer.progress`,
`findings_repository.documents`) is pre-existing and inert under report mode's
1-iteration pin — a possible follow-up, not a blocker. The sibling
`source_based_strategy` avoids the class of bug structurally by using a *local*
accumulator instead of a `self.` attribute; that is the cleaner long-term shape,
but the reset is correct as-is.

**Completeness check (does the reset drop sources?).** A natural worry is that
this change — which also moves the bibliography collection from a per-iteration
`all_links_of_system.extend(iteration_results)` *inside* the loop to a single
post-loop `all_links_of_system.extend(self.all_search_results)` — could leave the
source list incomplete. It does not, because `all_links_of_system` is **not**
reset: it is the cumulative, shared list (the *same* object as
`search_system.all_links_of_system`, search_system.py:229; the `id()` guard at
search_system.py:472-475 prevents the back-compat re-extend from doubling it).
Each `analyze_topic` call appends only *its own* accumulated results to that
shared list, so across report subsections it accumulates correctly:

| Step | `all_search_results` | `all_links_of_system` (shared) | offset |
|------|----------------------|--------------------------------|--------|
| Sub1 | reset→`[A,B,C]`      | `[A,B,C]`                      | 0 → [1,2,3] |
| Sub2 | reset→`[D,E]`        | `[A,B,C,D,E]`                  | 3 → [4,5] |
| Sub3 | reset→`[F]`          | `[A,B,C,D,E,F]`                | 5 → [6] |

On `main` the same scenario also ends with `[A…F]` in `all_links` — the `main`
bug was that Sub3's *synthesis* re-ingested A–E (overflow), not that sources went
missing. So **on the success path**, with the truncation ceiling (change #2) held
high enough never to fire, the PR's `all_links_of_system` contains the same
sources as `main` (verified for single-research mode, report mode, and the
follow-up delegate path, which propagates the delegate's sources via
`result["all_links_of_system"]` in `enhanced_contextual_followup.py:208-244`).
Nothing reads `all_links_of_system` mid-loop, so removing the per-iteration extend
breaks no incremental reader.

**One error-path caveat (adversarially verified).** Because the PR's *only*
`all_links_of_system.extend(...)` now lives *after* the loop, inside the same
`try` that wraps the loop (the catch-all `except Exception` in
`analyze_topic`; line 382 as of the #4850 merge), an **uncaught exception mid-loop** — e.g.
the unguarded `model.invoke` in question generation (`browsecomp_question.py:96`
and `:282`), which fails routinely on LLM rate-limit/timeout — skips that extend.
On `main`, the per-iteration extend had already recorded the completed iterations'
sources, so a degraded/failed single-research run still surfaces them in its
Sources list; on the PR, that failed run surfaces none. This is a real divergence,
but only on the *error* path (the run already returns `_create_error_response`),
and the PR's all-or-nothing behaviour is arguably *preferable* (no half-populated
bibliography from a run that errored out). In report mode it does not arise
(`max_iterations=1`: a mid-loop throw means iteration 1 never completed, so
neither side accumulated anything). It is **not** the "source list suddenly
incomplete" symptom on successful research — that one is change #2 alone (below).

### 2. `final_max_results` truncation ceiling — **DROP FROM THIS PR (cap is open for separate, benchmark-gated debate)**

The objection is to the *blind insertion-order slice as shipped in #4850*, not to
the idea of capping results in principle. A relevance-aware cap may have merit;
the maintainer is open to it as its own PR, decided with a benchmark (see the
"standing position" note below).

```python
max_results = int(self.get_setting("search.final_max_results", 100))
if len(self.all_search_results) > max_results:
    self.all_search_results = self.all_search_results[:max_results]   # blind, insertion-order
```

Why we do **not** want this:

- **It keeps the *first* 100, not the *best* 100.** Results accumulate
  iteration 1→8; the strategy's highest-value work (verification searches gated
  on `iteration > 3`) lands at the *tail* and is the first thing dropped. The
  proven sibling applies the *same* setting via
  `cross_engine_filter.filter_results(..., reorder=True, reindex=True)` —
  relevance-rank + dedup, then top-N (`source_based_strategy.py:421-431`). A raw
  `[:100]` slice does neither; the setting's own description even promises
  "deduplicating and filtering."
- **It runs unconditionally on the protected SimpleQA path** (8 iterations),
  which the docstring asks us to preserve. `main` applies **no** truncation
  here, so the 96.51% number was measured without it. At default
  `search.max_results=50` × 5 questions, the 100 ceiling is hit by ~iteration 2,
  discarding iterations 3–8 from synthesis — an unbenchmarked accuracy risk.
- **It is mostly unnecessary for the bug it targets.** Report mode already
  forces `max_iterations=1`, and change #1 (the reset) already fixes the
  overflow. The truncation's cost falls almost entirely on the *non-report* path
  it was not meant to touch.
- **It is the one change that actually shrinks the source list.** Per the
  completeness check under #1, `all_links_of_system` is otherwise complete. But
  in single-research mode (8 iterations producing, say, 250 results) the slice
  caps `all_search_results` at 100 *before* the `all_links` extend, so the
  returned `sources` / Sources section silently drops the other 150 (and keeps
  the *first* 100 by insertion order, not the best). On `main` all 250 are
  returned. This is exactly the "source list suddenly incomplete" failure mode —
  and it is caused by #2, not #1. Dropping #2 restores a complete, correctly
  numbered source list.
- **Minor robustness smell:** `int(get_setting(..., 100))` raises on a
  present-but-null/non-numeric value, and the surrounding `except Exception`
  converts that into a generic "Search iteration failed" *after* all search work
  (reachable via direct DB / programmatic `settings_snapshot`, not the validated
  UI).

This is **the third time** this exact change has been proposed:

- **#2001** — "apply final_max_results filtering in focused_iteration_strategy"
  (CrossEngineFilter, matching source-based). **Closed.** Maintainer:
  *"I am not so sure about this change. It is not what the strategy is supposed
  to be. Not every strategy should do the same thing."* and *"Outdated due to
  langraph strategy."*
- **#2067** — same idea, simpler. **Closed.**
- **#4850 (#2 of 3)** — same idea, blunter (`[:N]` instead of the filter).

**Standing position (open, not a flat no).** The decision for *this PR* is to drop
#2; the broader question of whether `focused-iteration` should cap results at all
is open for separate debate. Guardrails for that debate: (a) not every strategy
needs the same final-cap behaviour; (b) any cap must preserve the *best* sources
(relevance-rank/dedup, e.g. harvested from the V2/V3 work below), not drop them by
position; and (c) it should be gated on a SimpleQA benchmark proving no
regression. Note also that an earlier informal evaluation (maintainer's
recollection, details unverified) did not show a clear performance gain from a
results cap — a reason to benchmark before committing, not a settled conclusion.

**Post-merge evidence (2026-06-29).** After #4850 merged (with the truncation
dropped), the contributor reported still hitting the context-length error on
report mode: the reset fixes the *cross-subsection* leak, but nothing in the
strategy accounts for the model's context window within a single call, so a
sufficiently large single run can still overflow. That confirms #4851 had two
components — the state leak (fixed) and missing context-length awareness (not
fixed) — and it strengthens the case for having the capping debate. It does
*not* change the verdict on the blind head-slice: a context-aware or
relevance-aware mechanism under guardrails (a)–(c) above is the follow-up to
propose, not `[:100]`.

### 3. Citation offset — **ACCEPT**

```python
nr_of_links = total_citation_count_before_this_search  # = len(all_links_of_system), was hardcoded 0
```

In report mode each subsection previously re-numbered citations from `[1]`
(`nr_of_links=0`), so `[1]` meant different sources in different subsections and
desynced from the single shared bibliography that `format_links_to_markdown`
builds from `all_links_of_system`. Offsetting by the running link count makes
inline citations contiguous and collision-free across subsections, matching the
proven `source_based_strategy` invariant (verified by walking subsections 1→3:
no off-by-one, gap, or orphan). For single (non-report) research the offset is 0,
so citations still start at `[1]`.

Test coverage: an early revision of #4850 only tested change #1; the merged
version covers everything we asked for —
`test_does_not_accumulate_results_across_calls` (#1),
`test_citation_offset_uses_existing_all_links_count` and
`test_report_mode_indices_stay_sequential_across_sections` (#3).

## Cross-strategy comparison — #1 and #3 were focused-only oversights

The two fixes are not a cross-cutting change; they bring `focused-iteration` in
line with what the other production strategies already do. The contested
truncation (#2) matches *neither* sibling.

| Concern | focused (pre-#4850) | focused (post-#4850) | `langgraph-agent` (default) | `source-based` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **#1** Reset per-subsection working set | ❌ never reset (the leak) | ✅ resets `all_search_results` | ✅ `self.collector.reset()` (`langgraph_agent_strategy.py:788`) | ✅ *local* accumulator — no shared state to leak |
| **#3** Citation offset | ❌ `nr_of_links=0` | ✅ `len(all_links_of_system)` | ✅ `nr_of_links = len(self.all_links_of_system)` (`:789`) | ✅ `:178` / `:481` |
| **#2** `final_max_results` cap | none | blind `[:100]` | **none** (agent manages its own context) | proper: cross-engine filter `reorder=True, reindex=True` |

Takeaways:

- **#1 and #3 fix bugs unique to `focused-iteration`.** `langgraph-agent` and
  `source-based` already reset per subsection and already offset citations, so the
  fixes match two independent, already-shipping implementations — strong evidence
  they are correct.
- **#2 is an outlier in both directions.** Only `source-based` caps, and it does so
  *properly* (relevance reorder + reindex); `langgraph-agent` deliberately doesn't
  cap. A blind head-slice matches neither — extra evidence to drop it.
- Because `langgraph-agent` is the **default**, the #4851 overflow this PR fixes
  mainly bites users who switched to `focused-iteration` for report mode — which
  fits the "not the primary investment area" framing.

## Cross-section context & citation resolution (report mode)

Resetting the per-subsection working set raises a fair question: does a later
subsection still "know" what earlier ones used, and do in-text citations still
resolve? Both hold, because the relevant state is **not** what gets reset:

- **Coherence channel is independent of the reset.** Report generation feeds each
  subsection a `=== CONTENT ALREADY WRITTEN (DO NOT REPEAT) ===` block built from
  the previous sections' *generated content* (`report_generator.py:261-297`,
  `_build_previous_context`; default last 3 sections, char-capped), injected into
  the subsection query that drives both question generation and synthesis. This
  survives change #1 untouched. The `main` leak added *raw search results* on top
  of that — which is the overflow bug, not the coherence mechanism.
- **In-text citations still resolve.** Inline `[N]` markers are hyperlinked by
  index-matching against the structured source list
  (`text_optimization/citation_formatter.py` `apply_inline_hyperlinks`:
  `{str(s["index"]): (title, url)}`), and that list is the cumulative, un-reset
  `all_links_of_system`. With #3 giving each subsection a distinct index range,
  every `[N]` maps to exactly one bibliography entry. The reset removes sources
  from the per-subsection *synthesis input*, not from the *source list citations
  resolve against* — only #2's truncation removes anything from the latter.

**Known soft nuance (separate follow-up, not a blocker for #4850).**
`_build_previous_context` injects prior prose *with its old `[N]` markers intact*
(no stripping). After the reset, the current subsection's synthesis LLM sees those
numbers but no longer holds their source content (only its own offset-numbered
sources). They still resolve globally in the assembled report, and the "do not
repeat" instruction discourages echoing them, so this is a quality wrinkle rather
than broken links — and it is strictly *less* bad than `main`, where `nr_of_links=0`
made the numbers collide across sections. The clean fix (strip inline markers from
the context block, or wire a real `previous_knowledge` in place of the hardcoded
`""` in `focused_iteration_strategy.py`'s `analyze_followup` call, line 325 as of
the #4850 merge) belongs in its own PR.

## History of focused-iteration (for future readers)

- **#917** — introduced the strategy (standard + adaptive search).
- **#1277** — configurable options (the A/B knobs in `__init__`).
- **#1258 / #1282** — robustness (empty-questions ThreadPool crash; instruction
  injection when adaptive questions disabled).
- **#2293** — docs: suggest 10–20 iterations.
- **#2001 / #2067** — `final_max_results` truncation. **Both closed** (see above).
- **V2/V3/V4 A/B era (#2716 = V2, #2724 = V2+V3 combined, #2799 = V4 — all
  open):** separate, selectable strategies for benchmarking, leaving V1
  untouched. V2 adds **URL dedup**; V3 adds **semantic dedup + relevance
  sorting** (places most-relevant results last for context-window use); V4 swaps
  in a task-oriented question generator. Merged review-fix PRs from this era:
  #2797, #2980, #2996.
- **#4420 (merged):** removed ~22 experimental strategies + the
  `show_all_strategies` toggle. Survivors: `source-based`, `focused-iteration`,
  `focused-iteration-standard`, `topic-organization`, `mcp`, `langgraph-agent`
  (default). `mcp` was subsequently removed by #4548 (the factory now redirects
  it to `langgraph-agent`). The V2/V3/V4 strategy files are **not** on `main`.
- **#4711 / #4717 / #4729** — DRY refactors (base error-response + citation
  helpers, `run_parallel_searches`, post-merge cleanups).

## Open V2/V3/V4 PRs (#2716, #2724, #2799) — keep open, revisit later

**Status: undecided — left open on purpose.** This ADR records the context for a
future revisit rather than recommending closure now.

Factors to weigh when we come back to them:

- **Against merging as-is:** exploratory A/B artifacts (created March 2026;
  785 / 2,406 / 3,687 lines; `mergeable` UNKNOWN — likely heavy conflicts after
  #4711/#4717/#4729 and #4420); **never benchmarked** against V1 (#2716's
  SimpleQA checkbox is unchecked; #2724/#2799 don't mention a benchmark at
  all); and as standalone strategies they would re-add
  experimental options that #4420 deliberately removed, against the
  langgraph-first direction.
- **Worth keeping for:** the *ideas*, not the parallel strategies. V2's URL dedup
  and V3's relevance-sorting-before-cap are exactly the "keep the best, not the
  first" mechanism a future `focused-iteration` cap would need (see change #2).
  If a cap is ever justified, the cleanest path is to port that — small, targeted,
  into the single strategy — and benchmark it, rather than reviving three
  separate strategies.

No action on these PRs for now; this ADR just makes the trade-offs explicit so
the eventual decision is a quick one.

## Decision

We asked the contributor to **split**: keep changes #1 (reset) and #3 (citation
offset) — both correct, valuable bug fixes — and **drop #2 (truncation)**, plus
add the missing tests for #3. The contributor did exactly that, and #4850
merged on 2026-06-28 with #1 + #3 and tests for both. That shipped the
state-leak half of #4851 without reshaping the strategy's synthesis behaviour
or re-opening a question we had already closed twice.

## Consequences

- `focused-iteration` now resets its per-call working set and numbers citations
  contiguously across report subsections, matching `langgraph-agent` and
  `source-based`.
- No truncation was added; the 96.51%-SimpleQA synthesis path is
  behaviourally unchanged.
- The context-length half of #4851 remains open (see the post-merge evidence
  under change #2): any future cap must follow guardrails (a)–(c) —
  per-strategy justification, keep-the-best (not head-slice), SimpleQA
  benchmark gate.
- Follow-ups (separate PRs):
  1. **Cross-section context quality** — strip inline `[N]` markers from
     `_build_previous_context`, and/or wire a real `previous_knowledge` in
     place of the hardcoded `""` in `focused_iteration_strategy.py`'s
     `analyze_followup` call; verify with an LLM-judged before/after on a
     report-mode query (not unit-testable).
  2. **Optional refactor** — move `focused-iteration` to a *local* accumulator
     like `source-based`, so the per-call working set cannot leak by
     construction (removes the need to remember the reset).
  3. **If a result cap is ever wanted on `focused-iteration`** — port V2/V3's
     relevance-rank + dedup (not a blind slice), consider context-length
     awareness per the post-merge evidence, and gate it behind a SimpleQA
     benchmark.
