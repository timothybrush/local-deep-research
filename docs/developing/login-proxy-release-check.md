# Login rate-limit release check

The security release gate runs
`tests/integration/test_login_proxy_rate_limit.py` through real nginx and the
production uvicorn launcher. It verifies the single-proxy fix from #6442 for
the password-spraying bypass reported in #5787.

The 18 scenarios cover:

- `TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS` enabled and disabled.
- nginx overwriting both address headers, appending to X-Forwarded-For,
  adding a separate X-Forwarded-For line, and setting only X-Real-IP while
  clearing X-Forwarded-For.
- Different usernames with no forged headers and with rotating, repeated
  X-Forwarded-For headers plus a forged X-Real-IP.
- A second client retaining its own budget after the first is blocked.
- Repeated attempts against one username reaching account lockout before
  the IP limit. The test sets the account threshold to three to distinguish
  this from the five-attempt IP budget.

The probe requires real HTTP 401 responses before the limit and the production
IP limiter's JSON 429 body and retry headers afterwards. An account-lockout
response, CSRF rejection, or proxy-wide shared bucket cannot satisfy it.
All application state is temporary; the two servers listen only on loopback.
No existing accounts, provider credentials, or Redis service are used.

After installing development dependencies and nginx, run:

```sh
LDR_TESTING_WITH_MOCKS=false pdm run python -m pytest \
  tests/integration/test_login_proxy_rate_limit.py \
  -n 0 -p no:cov -v --tb=short --timeout=180
```

The proxy fixture skips mocked runs before checking for nginx or starting
either server. The integration marker also lets ordinary CI deselect these
tests. In `security-tests.yml`, the `proxy-login-tests` job runs them with
its own 15-minute timeout, separate from the `security-tests` job. nginx is
required there, and a separate report check rejects missing scenarios, skips,
failures, and errors. Because `release-gate.yml` already requires the whole
security workflow, a failed or timed-out probe blocks release publication.
Its JUnit report, pytest output, and server logs are uploaded as the
`proxy-login-reports` artifact.

This verifies the supported single-proxy rate-limit behavior. It does not
establish safe direct access from private peers, trust in arbitrary proxy
chains, or safety when an X-Real-IP-only proxy passes untrusted X-Forwarded-For
through. Those remain separate trust-policy concerns (#6849, #6850, #6851).

For the security advisory, verify a release containing #6442 and this check
before recording that version as patched. A passing run against `main` is
not a released fix. Until that release exists, operators of v1.10.7 should
overwrite both client-IP headers at their proxy and restrict access to the
application port to that proxy.
