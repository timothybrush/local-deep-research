# Egress modes — what each one does

LDR's **egress scope** (Settings → *Egress Scope*, or the *Privacy & Egress*
panel on the research form) controls **where your research traffic is allowed
to go** — which search engines run, whether your LLM/embeddings may be cloud
services, and which URLs may be fetched. It's the single switch for *"how much
of this run is allowed to leave my machine?"*

Pick a mode below. The default is **Adaptive**, which just follows your primary
search engine, so most people never need to think about it.

## At a glance

| Mode | Search engines | LLM / embeddings | Best for |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Adaptive** *(default)* | follows your primary engine | forced local **only** when the run is private | "just do the sensible thing" |
| **Unprotected** | any engine (no restriction) | any provider (cloud allowed) | escape hatch — **not recommended**; disables egress protection (hard SSRF / cloud-metadata blocking still applies) |
| **Public only** | public web/academic engines (plus collections you marked public and document stores whose URL is not classified as private) | your configured providers (a document-store primary with a cloud model is normally refused at start, see Strict below) | public research; your private collections aren't touched |
| **Private only** | local engines only (collections, your library, local document stores such as Paperless or Elasticsearch) | **forced local** — cloud blocked | sensitive work; best-effort private-only (see below) |
| **Strict** | **only** your one primary engine | your configured providers, but cloud models usually do not work (see below) | a single, exact source with zero expansion |

## <a id="adaptive"></a>🔀 Adaptive *(default)*

**Adaptive follows your primary search engine** and resolves to a concrete
mode for each run:

- Primary is a **public** engine (e.g. SearXNG pointed at a public instance,
  arXiv, PubMed) → behaves like **Public only**.
- Primary is a **private** source (a private collection, your library) →
  behaves like **Private only** (and therefore forces local LLM + embeddings).
- Primary is a collection you **marked public** (stored locally), or a primary
  that cannot be classified → resolves to an internal,
  more permissive scope that allows any classified engine, so private
  collections can also be queried in that run and inference is not forced
  local. Do not combine a public collection as primary with private
  collections you want kept away from a cloud model or from public search
  queries.

Why it's the default: you choose a search engine anyway, and the privacy
posture "just matches" it. If you make a **private collection** your primary,
the run behaves like **Private only** (best effort, see the caveats there).

> **Note:** to use a cloud LLM on a private collection, mark the collection
> **public** (see below), or use **Unprotected** if the operator has enabled
> it. Adding the provider to *trusted inference providers* is not expected to
> help here: a private primary normally resolves the run to **Private only**,
> which normally refuses cloud providers regardless of that list. Adaptive
> deliberately narrows to match the primary.

## <a id="unprotected"></a>🔓 Unprotected

**Not recommended — an operator-enabled escape hatch.** This mode is unavailable by default. The server operator must set `LDR_POLICY_ALLOW_UNPROTECTED_EGRESS=true` and restart the application. When enabled, egress-scope restrictions are disabled
for the run: any engine, URL, and LLM/embeddings provider is permitted. The
hard SSRF and cloud-metadata blocks still apply. A loud, non-dismissible banner
shows while it is active. Prefer marking a collection **public**, or adding a
**trusted inference provider** (`policy.trusted_inference_providers`, which
relaxes only the run-start check described under Strict) for the specific case,
over disabling protection wholesale. `policy.trusted_search_engines` currently
changes no decision, because that check only looks at the primary engine.

> Legacy `unprotected` selections (saved settings and already-queued
> research snapshots) are migrated to **Adaptive** by migration `0027` on
> upgrade, so they won't silently reactivate if an operator later turns the
> gate on. While the gate stays off, choosing `unprotected` for a new run or
> saving it as your default is refused; a queued run that still carries a
> residual `unprotected` snapshot runs as **Adaptive** instead.

> The older **Both** scope (blanket-permit any classified engine) has been
> **retired**: existing saved `both` configurations are migrated to **Adaptive**
> (which follows your primary engine and forces local inference for a private
> primary). If you relied on `both` to use a private collection with a cloud
> model, mark that collection **public**, or choose **Unprotected** to opt out
> of protection explicitly.

## <a id="public_only"></a>☁️ Public only

Only **public** engines run: web/academic engines, plus any collection you
marked public and any document store (Paperless, Elasticsearch) whose URL is not
classified as private — for example one that resolves to a public host, or
whose name does not resolve when the run starts. Your **private collections and
library, and document stores classified as private, are excluded**. If a
document store that counts as public is your primary, other public engines can
be queried in the same run, and the agent may build those queries from its
documents. URL fetches are normally allowed to public hosts and blocked for
private ones; the operator opt-in `LDR_SEARCH_ALLOW_PRIVATE_RESULT_FETCH`
described under Strict below is an exception. Inference is whatever you
configured (cloud allowed), but the run-start check described under Strict
below normally refuses a run whose primary is a document store when the model
is a cloud provider. Use it when you want public research and don't
want your private documents queried at all.

## <a id="private_only"></a>🔒 Private only

The privacy mode. **Only local engines** run (collections, your library,
local document stores such as Paperless or Elasticsearch).
Crucially, it **forces local LLM and embeddings** — cloud providers (OpenAI,
Anthropic, Google, OpenRouter, …) are normally refused, so LDR's own LLM and
embedding calls normally go only to endpoints it classifies as local.
Locality is judged by provider and endpoint address, not by where the model
runs: a local endpoint that relays to a hosted model (an Ollama cloud model,
or a local LiteLLM or other OpenAI-compatible proxy in front of a hosted API)
can pass the check, and your query and retrieved documents then reach that
hosted model. Public URL fetches are normally refused, and a best-effort
socket guard on the research run normally refuses connections to public
addresses (some of its gaps are listed under Strict below). This is a
best-effort guard rail, not an air gap; operators who need a hard boundary
should use OS- or network-level controls (see
[SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md#egress-policy-module)).

> If you have no local LLM configured, a Private-only run will refuse rather
> than silently fall back to the cloud — that's intentional (fail-closed).

## <a id="strict"></a>🎯 Strict

The tightest mode: **only your single primary engine** runs — no expansion to
any other engine at all.

Result and document fetches under Strict normally reach neither public nor
private hosts. Private hosts are normally refused because LDR's fetch-time
SSRF checks relax private addresses only under Private only — except when the
operator has set `LDR_SEARCH_ALLOW_PRIVATE_RESULT_FETCH` for an approved
public engine such as a self-hosted SearXNG: that engine's result fetches,
including redirects from its result URLs, can then reach private hosts under
any scope that lets the engine run, Strict included, whether or not it is the
primary (link-local and cloud-metadata addresses stay blocked). Public hosts
are normally stopped by the egress policy check or, on fetch paths without
one, by the socket guard described below (best effort).

Strict does **not** turn on the *Require local* toggles. A run-start check
normally refuses a run that pairs a private primary source (a private
collection, your library, or a local document store such as Paperless) with a
cloud LLM or, for a collection or the library, a cloud provider in the
*global* local-search embeddings setting. It does not look at the embedder a
collection was actually indexed with. Listing a provider under *trusted
inference providers* relaxes only that run-start check; the socket guard
below normally still refuses connections to a public address, so a trusted
cloud provider will usually still fail under Strict. This check (under every mode except Unprotected) runs only
where research goes through the web app's research pipeline: the start
request from the research form and the background research worker. Entry
points that call the research functions directly skip it — among others the
REST API's `/api/v1/quick_summary`, `/generate_report` and
`/analyze_documents`, benchmark runs, the MCP server, the in-process Python
functions such as `quick_summary` and `generate_report`, and scheduled
subscription runs. Set the *Require local*
toggles if you want local LLM and embeddings for every Strict run.

Like Private-only, Strict arms a best-effort socket guard on the research run
that normally refuses connections to public addresses, so a public primary
engine, public result fetches and cloud LLM or embedding calls usually fail
under Strict — pair it with a local engine and local models. An **Adaptive**
run that resolves to Private-only arms the same guard.

The guard is a backstop, not a guarantee. Gaps include, among others:

- traffic sent through a forward proxy (`HTTP_PROXY`/`HTTPS_PROXY`) on a
  private address: the guard sees only the proxy's address;
- a relay on a private address that forwards to the internet, such as a
  self-hosted SearXNG primary engine (the default Docker Compose setup) or a
  local proxy in front of a hosted model;
- connections reused from a shared keep-alive pool that another thread
  opened (some LLM clients share cached HTTP clients process-wide, and reusing
  a pooled connection opens no new socket for the guard to see);
- the headless Chromium used for JavaScript rendering
  (`web.enable_javascript_rendering`), which runs as a separate process;
- worker threads that do not carry the run's egress context.

## Per-collection public/private

Each RAG collection has a **public/private** flag (default **private**):

- A **private** collection is excluded under *Public only* and when *Adaptive*
  resolves to Public only (a public-engine primary; see the Adaptive section for
  a public-collection primary),
  and when it makes a run private (*Private only*, or an *Adaptive* run that
  resolves to Private only) it forces local inference, with the same
  best-effort limits described under *Private only* above. For *Strict*, see
  *Strict* above. Under *Unprotected* these restrictions are normally lifted.
- Mark a collection **public** (the *Public collection* checkbox when creating
  it) only if its contents are non-sensitive and you're happy to process them
  with cloud inference / use them under public scope.

## The two local-inference toggles

Independent of the scope, you can force local inference (except under
*Unprotected*, which normally lifts these toggles):

- **Require local LLM endpoint** — refuse cloud LLM providers / non-local URLs.
- **Require local embeddings** — refuse cloud embedders, and refuse a
  HuggingFace download for an uncached local model.

Both are **implied automatically** under *Private only* (and Adaptive-private),
which is why those toggles auto-check and lock when you select Private only.

LDR's curated Sentence Transformers models, including the default, require a
one-time policy-authorized download before they can be used from the local
cache. A model from the vetted list that is not already cached cannot be
downloaded while local embeddings are required. To install one using
**Library → Embedding Settings**, temporarily select *Public only*, or use
*Adaptive* with a public primary and no
private collection selected; turn off *Require local embeddings* if you enabled
it, then select the model and click **Test Embedding Model**. Restore your
preferred restrictive scope after the test succeeds. Runtime inference then
uses the local cache. If a download was interrupted, repeating the test under
an authorized public scope can repair its missing files at the same revision.
Curated cache checks require the module list, pooling and tokenizer configuration,
and each model's declared Transformer configuration before an offline load. This
preserves pooling, tokenizer selection, and token limits when metadata downloads
are interrupted.
Cached models outside the curated list and confined local model paths remain
cache-only and require compatible safetensors weights with remote code disabled.
An existing curated cache with no trustworthy immutable revision is refused,
even under a public scope; restore its trusted metadata or select another model.

## Research-form controls

The three primary controls — **Egress Scope**, **Require local LLM endpoint**,
and **Require local embeddings** — also appear on the research-form page in the
*Privacy & Egress* panel. Changing one there also saves it to your settings, so
it stays in effect for later runs until you change it back.

Under `Private only` or `Public only` Egress Scopes, the **Search Engine** dropdown
is scope-aware: engines that would be refused at submit time under the active scope are rendered disabled
with `aria-disabled="true"` and a one-line inline reason (e.g. *"Blocked: not a local
source under Private only"*), so the mismatch is visible before you click Start Research. Under `Adaptive`,
`Primary only (single engine)` (`Strict`), and `Unprotected` (when operator-enabled) modes, all primary search engines remain enabled
and selectable. Switching the scope automatically reconciles the selected engine value to an allowed option
if the current engine is disallowed under the new scope. Switching the scope or strategy re-evaluates the
dropdown state without a page reload. The backend precheck remains the enforcement boundary and second backstop.

## Audit log

Changes to any `policy.*` key, `llm.require_local_endpoint`,
`llm.allowed_local_hostnames`, or `embeddings.require_local` emit a
`policy_audit=True` log line so administrators can trace configuration changes.
Those audit lines are deliberately filtered out of the WebSocket progress
stream (they never reach browser subscribers).
