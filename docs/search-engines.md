# Search Engines Guide

Local Deep Research integrates with multiple search engines to provide comprehensive research capabilities. This guide covers all available search engines, their specializations, and configuration details.

> **Note**: This documentation is maintained by the community and may contain inaccuracies. While we strive to keep it up-to-date, please verify critical information and report any errors via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/LearningCircuit/local-deep-research/issues).

## Overview

LDR supports three categories of search engines:
- **Free Search Engines** - No API key required
- **Premium Search Engines** - Require API keys but offer enhanced features
- **Custom Sources** - Your own documents and databases

## Search Engine Selection

### Dynamic Engine Selection (Recommended)

The default `langgraph-agent` strategy selects the most appropriate engines dynamically per query: every enabled engine (and any registered retriever or local collection) is exposed to the research agent as a tool, and the agent decides which to call for each sub-question. You only pick a primary engine (`searxng` is the recommended default):

```python
result = quick_summary(
    query="What are the latest advances in quantum computing?",
    search_tool="searxng"  # Primary engine; the langgraph-agent strategy
                           # can still pull in other enabled engines per query
)
```

> **Note**: The former `auto` and `parallel` meta engines were removed — the langgraph-agent strategy replaces them. Stored settings are migrated automatically; explicit `search_tool="auto"` callers should switch to a concrete engine like `searxng`.

## Rate Limiting and Reliability

LDR includes intelligent adaptive rate limiting that:
- Learns optimal wait times for each engine
- Automatically retries failed requests
- Prevents your IP from being blocked
- Maintains high reliability

### Managing Rate Limits

Rate-limit statistics (per-engine wait times and success rates) are shown
in the Rate Limiting section of the metrics dashboard
(`/metrics`). The learned wait times can be tuned with the rate limiting
profile setting (conservative, balanced, aggressive).

## Search Strategies

LDR supports multiple search strategies that determine how queries are processed:

- **langgraph-agent**: Agentic research that picks engines dynamically per query (default)
- **source-based**: Single query, fast results
- **focused_iteration**: Iterative refinement for accuracy

## Best Practices

1. **For General Research**: Use `searxng` with the default langgraph-agent strategy
2. **For Academic Research**: Combine `arxiv`, `pubmed`, and `semantic_scholar`
3. **For Technical Questions**: Use `github` with `searxng`
4. **For Maximum Privacy**: Use `searxng` with local Ollama models
5. **For Best Quality**: Use `tavily` or Google with `focused_iteration` strategy

## Troubleshooting

### SearXNG Not Working
- Verify container is running: `docker ps | grep searxng`
- Check URL in settings: `http://localhost:8080`
- Test directly: `curl http://localhost:8080`
- Check the logs: `docker logs searxng` or view them in the LDR web UI

### Rate Limit Errors
- Wait a few minutes and retry
- Use the langgraph-agent strategy, which can route around rate-limited engines
- Consider adding premium engines for higher limits

### No Results Found
- Try different search engines
- Broaden your query
- Check internet connectivity
- Verify API keys for premium engines

## Advanced Configuration

### Configuring Search Engines

You can enable/disable specific search engines and adjust their reliability parameters in the settings. This affects which engines the langgraph-agent strategy can choose from and how the system handles rate limiting.

### Multi-Engine Research

The former `auto` and `parallel` meta engines (which fanned a query out over several engines) have been removed. To research across multiple engines, use the default langgraph-agent strategy: it calls any enabled engine as a tool, in parallel where useful, and picks per sub-question which engines to query.
