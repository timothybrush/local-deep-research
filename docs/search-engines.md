# Search Engines Guide

Local Deep Research integrates with multiple search engines to provide comprehensive research capabilities. This guide covers all available search engines, their specializations, and configuration details.

> **Note**: This documentation is maintained by the community and may contain inaccuracies. While we strive to keep it up-to-date, please verify critical information and report any errors via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/LearningCircuit/local-deep-research/issues).

## Overview

LDR supports three categories of search engines:
- **Free Search Engines** - No API key required
- **Premium Search Engines** - Require API keys but offer enhanced features
- **Custom Sources** - Your own documents and databases

## Search Engine Selection

### Dynamic Engine Selection (Recommended)

The default `langgraph-agent` strategy selects the most appropriate engines dynamically per query: every enabled engine (and any registered retriever or local collection) is exposed to the research agent as a tool, and the agent decides which to call for each sub-question. You only pick a primary engine (`searxng` is the recommended default):

```python
result = quick_summary(
    query="What are the latest advances in quantum computing?",
    search_tool="searxng"  # Primary engine; the langgraph-agent strategy
                           # can still pull in other enabled engines per query
)
```

> **Note**: The former `auto` and `parallel` meta engines were removed — the langgraph-agent strategy replaces them. Stored settings are migrated automatically; explicit `search_tool="auto"` callers should switch to a concrete engine like `searxng`.

## Free Search Engines

  approval in the server environment — its origin listed in
  `LDR_SEARCH_PRIVATE_ENGINE_URL_ALLOWLIST=http://localhost:8080`
  (recommended, v1.10.5+), env-locking the URL
  (as the bundled docker-compose does), or the blanket
  `LDR_SEARCH_ALLOW_PRIVATE_ENGINE_URLS=true` — only one is needed — see
  [SearXNG-Setup](SearXNG-Setup.md)

## Rate Limiting and Reliability

LDR includes intelligent adaptive rate limiting that:
- Learns optimal wait times for each engine
- Automatically retries failed requests
- Prevents your IP from being blocked
- Maintains high reliability

### Managing Rate Limits

Rate-limit statistics (per-engine wait times and success rates) are shown
in the Rate Limiting section of the metrics dashboard
(`/metrics`). The learned wait times can be tuned with the rate limiting
profile setting (conservative, balanced, aggressive).

## Search Strategies

LDR supports multiple search strategies that determine how queries are processed:

- **langgraph-agent**: Agentic research that picks engines dynamically per query (default)
- **source-based**: Single query, fast results
- **focused_iteration**: Iterative refinement for accuracy

## Best Practices

1. **For General Research**: Use `searxng` with the default langgraph-agent strategy
2. **For Academic Research**: Combine `arxiv`, `pubmed`, and `semantic_scholar`
3. **For Technical Questions**: Use `github` with `searxng`
4. **For Maximum Privacy**: Use `searxng` with local Ollama models
5. **For Best Quality**: Use `tavily` or Google with `focused_iteration` strategy

## Troubleshooting

### SearXNG Not Working
- Check the LDR logs for `SearXNG engine disabled: instance URL … is a
  private / loopback / link-local address` — if present, add the URL origin
  to `LDR_SEARCH_PRIVATE_ENGINE_URL_ALLOWLIST` (or set
  `LDR_SEARCH_ALLOW_PRIVATE_ENGINE_URLS=true`) in the server environment and
  restart (see [SearXNG-Setup](SearXNG-Setup.md))
- Verify container is running: `docker ps | grep searxng`
- Check URL in settings: `http://localhost:8080`
- Test directly: `curl http://localhost:8080`
- Check the logs: `docker logs searxng` or view them in the LDR web UI

### Rate Limit Errors
- Wait a few minutes and retry
- Use the langgraph-agent strategy, which can route around rate-limited engines
- Consider adding premium engines for higher limits

### Temporarily Disabled Engines

During LangGraph research, an engine that reports a failure is removed from
subsequent model tool choices. The lead agent and its subagents share this state
for the research run. Calls already proposed are checked again before engine
creation, so a disabled engine is not repeatedly initialized or queried.
Searches are never serialized: parallel searches of one engine, including its
first calls and retries after a cooldown, run concurrently, and the first
failure disables the engine for all of them. Searches already in flight may
finish.

A cooldown never ends the research. When every search engine the agent (or a
subagent) could use is disabled and at least one of them only for a cooldown,
the next model call waits for the soonest cooldown to end (checking for
cancellation every second, never longer than ten minutes in total) and then
offers that engine again. Tools come back as soon as their cooldown ends, at
any step of the run, not only when a run or report section starts. This can
add waiting time while an engine keeps failing; the research log says how long.

Waiting is bounded per research run, so an engine that keeps failing cannot
keep a run waiting and retrying for hours:

- All cooldown waits in one run share a budget of fifteen minutes (parallel
  subagents waiting at the same time spend it once). When the next cooldown
  would not end within what is left, the cooling engines are disabled for the
  rest of the run instead.
- An engine that enters a cooldown three times in a row without a successful
  search in between (a search with no matches counts as successful) is
  disabled for the rest of the run on its next failure.
- A provider `Retry-After` longer than ten minutes is not waited for: the
  engine is disabled for the rest of the run.

Once that leaves no search engine, the rules below for engines disabled for
the rest of the run apply.

If every search engine is disabled for the rest of the run but page fetching
is enabled, the agent keeps only `fetch_content`: it can still read URLs from
the query or from earlier results, but it cannot find new sources and may
answer without searching (it is told to say when evidence is insufficient). If
every research tool is disabled for the rest of the run, the model is not
called without tools: the research (or the current detailed-report section)
stops, and the answer is written from the sources gathered so far. A section
stopped before gathering any sources is rendered as “*Limited information was
found for this subsection.*”; the research log records the stop as an error
line, while overall report progress continues.
Availability also propagates through the optional full-content search wrapper.

Only engines that report failures take part in this. Currently that is
`arxiv`, `openalex`, `pubmed`, `searxng`, `semantic_scholar`, `serper`,
`wayback`, `wikinews`, and `wikipedia`, plus the full-content search wrapper,
along with any engine whose exceptions propagate through the base search
pipeline. Engines that catch request errors themselves without recording a
failure — most of the remaining engines — currently fail silently per request:
they return empty results, stay available, and are never disabled, exactly as
before this change.

The research log records the reason, disable time, and retry time. The
“selecting next action” status lists the available tools and explains disabled
engines separately. A search skipped because its engine is disabled or cooling
down is recorded in search metrics with the status `skipped_unavailable` and
the reason: the Metrics dashboard and the research details page show these
skips per engine, separately from searches that were sent, so they do not
change call counts, response times or success rates. Cooldowns expire automatically; the engine then becomes
eligible for another search, and the log records that retry is available.

- Rate limits: use the provider's `Retry-After` value when reported, otherwise
  wait five minutes after the engine's retries are exhausted. No cooldown is
  longer than ten minutes: a longer `Retry-After` disables the engine for the
  rest of the research instead. Retries may
  happen in the HTTP client rather than the search pipeline: Semantic
  Scholar's session retries HTTP 429 itself, honoring `Retry-After` up to 30
  seconds per retry (at most five retries), and when those retries run out the engine is disabled for five minutes once its
  fallback queries are also used up. Exhausted retries on HTTP 5xx count as an
  ordinary search failure. Any non-JSON Wikipedia response (normally its HTML
  429 page) is treated as a rate limit, because its client library discards
  the HTTP status; a non-JSON server error therefore also waits five minutes.
- Connection failures, timeouts, and other search failures: wait one minute.
  HTTP 503 uses the provider's `Retry-After` when reported (a longer one than
  ten minutes disables the engine for the rest of the research).
- A request URL refused by security validation: wait five minutes. The
  validator also refuses hosts that cannot be resolved, so a DNS outage is
  retried rather than treated as a configuration error.
- HTTP 403: wait five minutes, because it is often a temporary bot or firewall
  block. A 403 whose reply is clearly about credentials (it asks for
  authentication or mentions an API key, token, subscription or billing) is
  treated as denied credentials below. So is any 403 from Semantic Scholar
  when an API key is configured: it rejects an invalid key with a plain
  `{"message":"Forbidden"}` reply.
- Denied credentials/access (HTTP 401/402, or such a 403) or a private/loopback
  SearXNG instance URL without server approval, when the engine reports such a
  failure: disable for the rest of the research. Correct the configuration before
  starting another run. This does not change saved engine settings.
- A successful search with no matches is still available. Usable partial
  results also keep an engine available, and so does a search whose results
  all arrived but were then dropped by the relevance filter (or failed a later
  filtering step): the provider answered.
- Errors specific to one query do not disable the engine: a query the provider
  rejects as malformed (HTTP 400, 414 or 422) is reported back to the agent to
  rephrase, and a non-JSON Wayback Machine reply for one URL (such as its
  "blocked site" page) counts only against that URL. SearXNG listing unresponsive backends
  alongside no results counts as no matches, because it does not report which
  backends were queried.

Availability tracking lives in `web_search_engines/engine_availability.py` and
has no LangGraph dependency. `advanced_search_system/tools/search_availability.py`
adapts it to the agent. Engines that catch request exceptions and return an
empty list must preserve the failure using `BaseSearchEngine._record_search_failure`
or set `last_search_failure` to a `SearchFailure`. Optional enrichment errors
should not be reported as search failures.

### No Results Found
- Try different search engines
- Broaden your query
- Check internet connectivity
- Verify API keys for premium engines

## Advanced Configuration

### Configuring Search Engines

You can enable/disable specific search engines and adjust their reliability parameters in the settings. This affects which engines the langgraph-agent strategy can choose from and how the system handles rate limiting.

### Multi-Engine Research

The former `auto` and `parallel` meta engines (which fanned a query out over several engines) have been removed. To research across multiple engines, use the default langgraph-agent strategy: it calls any enabled engine as a tool, in parallel where useful, and picks per sub-question which engines to query.
