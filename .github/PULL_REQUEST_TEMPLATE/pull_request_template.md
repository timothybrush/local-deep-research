## CI test coverage

Lint, security and focused checks run automatically. The shared test image is built only when full pytest or a selected focused check needs it. When this PR is nearly ready, add `test:pytest`, `code-ready`, `code-ready-preliminary`, or `auto-merge` to request the full pytest suite. Passing full pytest remains required before merge; until requested, that check reports a short failure explaining the missing label. Later pushes rerun the suite while any of those labels remains.

Additional heavy suites use these labels:

- `test:puppeteer` — Puppeteer E2E suite (~30–60 min; uses paid LLM/search API quotas). `test:e2e` is a legacy alias.
- `test:notes` — focused Notes Playwright E2E suite (re-runs on later pushes while the label remains).
- `test:ui-full-shards` — full sharded UI matrix plus the strict Docker CI graph (expensive).
- `ldr_research` or `ldr_research_static` — LDR research integration workflow that posts findings as a PR comment.

The AI reviewer can recommend these selectors but never applies them: each one
spends paid API quota and CI wall-clock, so a maintainer makes that call. Most
of these workflows also trigger on `labeled` only, which a label added with the
reviewer's `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot start; `test:notes` is the exception, since it
re-runs on every push while the label is present.

WebKit/Mobile Safari tests run on the daily 02:00 UTC schedule and at release; the responsive UI suite runs at release and on manual dispatch.
