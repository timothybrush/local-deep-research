# Combine multiple per-model AI code reviews into a single sticky PR comment.
#
# This is the pure-assembly half of the AI Code Reviewer workflow
# (.github/workflows/ai-code-reviewer.yml), split out so the non-trivial parts —
# header/footer stripping, "Reviewer N" section assembly, label union, and the
# pass/fail aggregation — can be unit-tested without any network or GitHub API
# access. The workflow runs the models (network) and writes each reviewer's raw
# stdout to resp_<i>.json and its exit code to code_<i>; this script turns those
# into the comment body, label set, decision, and success count.
#
# Usage:
#   combine-ai-reviews.sh <work_dir> <model_1> [<model_2> ...]
#
#   Reads, for i in 0..N-1 (N = number of model args):
#     <work_dir>/resp_<i>.json  - raw stdout from ai-reviewer.sh for reviewer i
#     <work_dir>/code_<i>        - that reviewer's integer exit code
#     <work_dir>/err_<i>.log     - that reviewer's stderr (only shown in DEBUG)
#   The model names are used only for the per-reviewer log-group labels; the
#   posted comment stays anonymized ("Reviewer 1", "Reviewer 2", ...).
#
#   Environment:
#     HEAD_SHA    - head commit sha for the "Last reviewed at commit" line (opt)
#     DEBUG_MODE  - "true" to echo raw responses + stderr to this script's stderr
#
#   Writes (into <work_dir>):
#     comment_body.md    - the combined sticky-comment body
#     labels.txt         - approved labels to apply, one per line (may be empty)
#     trigger_labels.txt - CI trigger labels to recommend, one per line
#     rejected_labels.json - model-suggested labels rejected by policy
#     decision.txt       - "pass" or "fail"
#     success_count.txt  - number of reviewers that produced a usable review
#   And, transiently, requested_labels.jsonl (the per-reviewer suggestion
#   accumulator): removed once the policy filter has read it, on the success
#   path only — an abnormal termination (e.g. the caller's job timing out)
#   can leave it behind, so the workflow's Cleanup step also removes it.
#
#   Logs ::group:: sections and debug output to stderr (kept off stdout so the
#   output files are the only contract). Exit status is 0 even when every
#   reviewer failed — the caller inspects success_count.txt and decides whether
#   to fail the workflow. A non-zero exit indicates a usage, policy configuration, or assembly error.

# Model output is unbounded, and .labels_added is the only part of it that is
# aggregated across reviewers. Two limits keep it away from argv: Linux caps a
# single execve argument at MAX_ARG_STRLEN (128 KiB), so passing the growing
# accumulator as `jq --argjson "$ACC"` made jq fail to start once the models
# had produced ~128 KiB of label text — and under `set -euo pipefail` that
# aborted the whole script before *any* output file was written, sinking every
# reviewer and posting no comment at all.
#   1. MAX_LABELS_* bounds one reviewer's suggestion list. A real review names
#      a handful of labels; anything past these bounds is malformed output and
#      its labels are dropped wholesale — but unlike a non-object response
#      above, only the label channel degrades: the review body is kept, the
#      verdict still counts toward success_count and can still flip
#      decision.txt to "fail", and the drop is reported (see the oversized-
#      reviewer warning below) rather than silently discarding the reviewer.
#   2. The accumulator lives in a file read with --slurpfile, so even N
#      at-the-limit reviewers can never reach the argv cap.
